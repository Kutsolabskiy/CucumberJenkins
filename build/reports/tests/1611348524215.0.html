","specialistOverview":"\u003cp\u003eMy name is Katrina. I have lived studied and worked in the UK for 20 years. I used to be a college lecturer, specialised in adult Autism. I am now back on my home territory of Malaysian Borneo, where I run and own a stress management centre, called 'Whole Life Stress Management'. The aim of my centre is to help people gain better health and control over their lives. At my studio I help individuals on a 121 basis get control over their challenges. This could be helping people manage their weight, conquer physical pain, anxiety and depression. I have an MA in adult autism, that relates to anxiety, and I have also derived a course particularly for that in mind. Through experience, I have found most people's problems relate to the stress they endure in this modern world we live in. I have therefore decided to create courses of what I do at my centre, online so that it is opened to the rest of the world to access. My courses concentrate on approaching health, wellness, weight loss and youthfulness as well as conquering one's own authenticity and gaining independence through the art of stress management. It's all about conquering challenging emotions before considering food and lifestyle choices.

A part from my passion for travel and off course teaching English, i also enjoy writing and reading in my free time, particularly about topics that analyse our society and people ... yes i am completely obsessed with TED too, naturally.\n\nMany years ago i decided to live in Italy where i started teaching english in some of the schools in Rome, but i understood straight away that those schools had a terrible defect: \"they all used just one single and repetitive method\" but i believed that every student learnt in a different way.\n\nThat's why i opened my very own school in Rome, where i was finally able to freely teach my students in my own way. This experience allowed me to grow as a teacher, as an entrepreuner but above all as a motivational speaker. Yes, beacuse students must be continuously motivated.\n\nLiving in Italy i learnt first hand what it's like to have to learn another language, therefore my teaching approach is completely based around helping my students overcome the English language jitters and I concentrate on improving confidence and motivation within all my lessons\n\nTeaching gives me huge satisfaction, especially when students thank me after i have helped them pass a job interview, prepare for a work presentation, get a certificate like Cambridge or IELTS, pass a university exam, a contest or to get better marks at school.\n\nOk i think you got the point, so..","firstName":"Gaia Valentina","lastName":"Massara","photo":{"id":"2e98c571-c4a6-440c-ba3c-87f4f544ee9d","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"fbPromotionAvailable":true,"fbLookAlikePromotionAvailable":true,"fbIntroVideoPromotionAvailable":true,"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":9153,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":263,"countAttachments":0},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"COMPLETED"},"subtitlesLangs":[],"language":{"id":"60094d24883fb20001190fe0","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"enrolled":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"3607b94d-4b6d-4761-9a98-391f642f47f6","accountId":"3607b94d-4b6d-4761-9a98-391f642f47f6","slug":"the-complete-english-for-job-interview-course-2019-edition","topicIds":["5408f13c-8541-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa"],"subTopicIds":["97b9c888-9292-4dcf-a302-2b82b70231d0"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":3215.5,"rating":0,"rate":19.99,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"5408f13c-8541-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa","name":"Academics \u0026 Languages"},"subTopics":[{"id":"97b9c888-9292-4dcf-a302-2b82b70231d0","name":"English"}],"metrics":{"SEARCH":7637,"VIEW":5765,"CLICK":293,"FEED":17737,"PURCHASE":4},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Gaia Valentina Massara","courseName":"The Complete English for Job Interview course | 2019 Edition","courseDescription":"Success your job interview in English, improve your confidence, English grammar and answer job interview questions."},{"id":"5d9d78bbb2d9e50001ec7db5","createdAt":1574680895715,"modifiedAt":1609848916892,"version":5279,"payload":{"id":"5d9d78bbb2d9e50001ec7db5","createdAt":1609844311769,"updatedAt":1609848916844,"parentId":"","specialistId":"5d9cbe5db2d9e50001e77884","accountId":"ba72ac84-c0d2-47da-9ba0-163140a44710","topicId":"cf6ab549-1880-45bf-9e94-1b9e9296b08f","subTopicId":"0b9e1c7f-164e-42b5-b8f2-325c40938d93","name":"Adobe Lightroom CC: Landscape Photography Masterclass 2021","slug":"adobe-lightroom-cc-landscape-photography-masterclass-2020","description":"\u003cp\u003eHi, my name is Fabian Rosshirt.

Always hungry to learn and expand his musical knowledge he studied under some of the foremost teachers at the time. \n\nHe spent the 80s honing not only his performance and technical skills but also his teaching abilities.\n\nAs well as performing in various rock bands he started teaching in various schools and academies including Kent County Schools where he was employed as their first contemporary music instructor for the guitar.\n\nIn the late 80s he relocated to London, working in recording studios recording and doing session work during the daytime and playing live in the numerous bars and clubs in the evenings. He also set up his own private teaching company. As his experience working in studios grew he began to record music for advertising and marketing companies, and small radio stations. As well as his teaching role he worked as a session musician recording music for record companies including Virgin Records and Acid Jazz.\n\nIn the 90s he made the bold step of moving to Florida. Where he focused on teaching, working privately and also in schools in the Orlando region. During that time, he was lucky to meet some great musicians that encouraged him to continue his own personal studies and grow his musical knowledge.\n\nAs one who loves to travel and see new places he decided that his next stop would be Panama. A great place to learn Jazz and amazing Latin Rhythm. He really enjoyed his time down there and worked some wonderful bars and clubs. It felt like everyone wanted to learn to play the guitar, young and old.\n\nNext stop was Dubai. Here he focused 100% on teaching.

","specialistOverview":"\u003cp\u003eMy name is Katrina. I have lived studied and worked in the UK for 20 years. I used to be a college lecturer, specialised in adult Autism. I am now back on my home territory of Malaysian Borneo, where I run and own a stress management centre, called 'Whole Life Stress Management'. The aim of my centre is to help people gain better health and control over their lives. At my studio I help individuals on a 121 basis get control over their challenges. This could be helping people manage their weight, conquer physical pain, anxiety and depression. I have an MA in adult autism, that relates to anxiety, and I have also derived a course particularly for that in mind. Through experience, I have found most people's problems relate to the stress they endure in this modern world we live in. I have therefore decided to create courses of what I do at my centre, online so that it is opened to the rest of the world to access. My courses concentrate on approaching health, wellness, weight loss and youthfulness as well as conquering one's own authenticity and gaining independence through the art of stress management. It's all about conquering challenging emotions before considering food and lifestyle choices. It's a different approach to mental and physical health that deals with our challenges with kindness, love and patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy consultations are for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdult High Functioning Autism - Work/Life Strategies and Stress Management\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor others: Kundalini Yoga Sessions (As part of the consultation)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeditation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStress Management strategies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealthy Eating for weight loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to lose weight intuitively\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am now in the UK. \u0026nbsp;I help people heal through chakra clearing Kundalini yoga, particularly if you have suffered from trauma of some sort. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","firstName":"Katrina","lastName":"Zawawi","photo":{"id":"f94fca60-32c2-4065-b299-b3428c578a78","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[{"id":"9c20a951-2ded-45a5-85d5-11328ccfd7be","type":"3 months","typeName":"THREE_MONTH","amountValue":101.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":3,"order":20},{"id":"b3a8c246-7f74-4473-9e2c-e3b0b91c505e","type":"12 months","typeName":"TWELVE_MONTH","amountValue":551.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":12,"order":40},{"id":"06604f95-32e6-42b7-bd6d-b66171949024","type":"1 month","typeName":"ONE_MONTH","amountValue":51.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":1,"order":10,"preferred":true}]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":21412,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":657,"countAttachments":0},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"FAILED"},"subtitlesLangs":[],"language":{"id":"60094d24883fb20001190fe0","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"enrolled":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","accountId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","slug":"lose-weight-and-get-into-shape-intuitively","topicIds":["7e14ea33-6139-4f1f-adb0-9db52041a8c7"],"subTopicIds":["f24990ca-0504-4a9f-bc5f-ceaaee721f5e"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":1672.5,"rating":0,"rate":99.99,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"7e14ea33-6139-4f1f-adb0-9db52041a8c7","name":"Health and Fitness"},"subTopics":[{"id":"f24990ca-0504-4a9f-bc5f-ceaaee721f5e","name":"Fitness"}],"metrics":{"SEARCH":8633,"CLICK":241,"VIEW":2843,"FEED":16207,"PURCHASE":1},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Katrina Zawawi","courseName":"Lose Weight and get into shape intuitively","courseDescription":"This weight/fat loss course works because many diets and strict exercise regimes don't.\u003cdiv\u003eIt works on the principle that:\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Everyone is determined to begin with, but then the rebellious human nature kicks in during a diet/weight loss programme, even if you are succeeding on it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*I\u0026nbsp;have been on so many diet/exercise regimes and I\u0026nbsp;always manage to gain the weight/fat again.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eStrictness =\u0026nbsp; rebelliousness, after a while.\u0026nbsp; Does this sound familiar to you?\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Worrying about dieting and weight loss itself brings all kinds of stress.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eStress hormones can make you fat and retain the weight you have.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Many exercise regimes don't take into account how the body may feel fatigued. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eEven if your body doesn't feel fatigued, emotionally, you may do - and this can have an impact on weight loss progress.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Following programmes can be tedious and take so much time out of our days, that we dedicate all of our energies to it.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Being on a diet can make us really moody and not fun to be around.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*A drastic change, like a dietary programme and exercise regime can take an emotional toll on the body.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eDoes this all resonate with your experiences of trying to lose weight?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Your'e probably wondering, what makes this programme so different.\u0026nbsp; Well, it's easy really!.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eTherefore, I\u0026nbsp;have created a course where:\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e1.

A part from my passion for travel and off course teaching English, i also enjoy writing and reading in my free time, particularly about topics that analyse our society and people ... yes i am completely obsessed with TED too, naturally.\n\nMany years ago i decided to live in Italy where i started teaching english in some of the schools in Rome, but i understood straight away that those schools had a terrible defect: \"they all used just one single and repetitive method\" but i believed that every student learnt in a different way.\n\nThat's why i opened my very own school in Rome, where i was finally able to freely teach my students in my own way. This experience allowed me to grow as a teacher, as an entrepreuner but above all as a motivational speaker. Yes, beacuse students must be continuously motivated.\n\nLiving in Italy i learnt first hand what it's like to have to learn another language, therefore my teaching approach is completely based around helping my students overcome the English language jitters and I concentrate on improving confidence and motivation within all my lessons\n\nTeaching gives me huge satisfaction, especially when students thank me after i have helped them pass a job interview, prepare for a work presentation, get a certificate like Cambridge or IELTS, pass a university exam, a contest or to get better marks at school.\n\nOk i think you got the point, so..","firstName":"Gaia Valentina","lastName":"Massara","photo":{"id":"2e98c571-c4a6-440c-ba3c-87f4f544ee9d","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"fbPromotionAvailable":true,"fbLookAlikePromotionAvailable":true,"fbIntroVideoPromotionAvailable":true,"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":9153,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":263,"countAttachments":0},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"COMPLETED"},"subtitlesLangs":[],"language":{"id":"60094d24883fb20001190fe0","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"enrolled":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"3607b94d-4b6d-4761-9a98-391f642f47f6","accountId":"3607b94d-4b6d-4761-9a98-391f642f47f6","slug":"the-complete-english-for-job-interview-course-2019-edition","topicIds":["5408f13c-8541-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa"],"subTopicIds":["97b9c888-9292-4dcf-a302-2b82b70231d0"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":3215.5,"rating":0,"rate":19.99,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"5408f13c-8541-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa","name":"Academics \u0026 Languages"},"subTopics":[{"id":"97b9c888-9292-4dcf-a302-2b82b70231d0","name":"English"}],"metrics":{"SEARCH":7637,"VIEW":5765,"CLICK":293,"FEED":17737,"PURCHASE":4},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Gaia Valentina Massara","courseName":"The Complete English for Job Interview course | 2019 Edition","courseDescription":"Success your job interview in English, improve your confidence, English grammar and answer job interview questions."},{"id":"5d9d78bbb2d9e50001ec7db5","createdAt":1574680895715,"modifiedAt":1609848916892,"version":5279,"payload":{"id":"5d9d78bbb2d9e50001ec7db5","createdAt":1609844311769,"updatedAt":1609848916844,"parentId":"","specialistId":"5d9cbe5db2d9e50001e77884","accountId":"ba72ac84-c0d2-47da-9ba0-163140a44710","topicId":"cf6ab549-1880-45bf-9e94-1b9e9296b08f","subTopicId":"0b9e1c7f-164e-42b5-b8f2-325c40938d93","name":"Adobe Lightroom CC: Landscape Photography Masterclass 2021","slug":"adobe-lightroom-cc-landscape-photography-masterclass-2020","description":"\u003cp\u003eHi, my name is Fabian Rosshirt.

Always hungry to learn and expand his musical knowledge he studied under some of the foremost teachers at the time. \n\nHe spent the 80s honing not only his performance and technical skills but also his teaching abilities.\n\nAs well as performing in various rock bands he started teaching in various schools and academies including Kent County Schools where he was employed as their first contemporary music instructor for the guitar.\n\nIn the late 80s he relocated to London, working in recording studios recording and doing session work during the daytime and playing live in the numerous bars and clubs in the evenings. He also set up his own private teaching company. As his experience working in studios grew he began to record music for advertising and marketing companies, and small radio stations. As well as his teaching role he worked as a session musician recording music for record companies including Virgin Records and Acid Jazz.\n\nIn the 90s he made the bold step of moving to Florida. Where he focused on teaching, working privately and also in schools in the Orlando region. During that time, he was lucky to meet some great musicians that encouraged him to continue his own personal studies and grow his musical knowledge.\n\nAs one who loves to travel and see new places he decided that his next stop would be Panama. A great place to learn Jazz and amazing Latin Rhythm. He really enjoyed his time down there and worked some wonderful bars and clubs. It felt like everyone wanted to learn to play the guitar, young and old.\n\nNext stop was Dubai. Here he focused 100% on teaching.

","specialistOverview":"\u003cp\u003eMy name is Katrina. I have lived studied and worked in the UK for 20 years. I used to be a college lecturer, specialised in adult Autism. I am now back on my home territory of Malaysian Borneo, where I run and own a stress management centre, called 'Whole Life Stress Management'. The aim of my centre is to help people gain better health and control over their lives. At my studio I help individuals on a 121 basis get control over their challenges. This could be helping people manage their weight, conquer physical pain, anxiety and depression. I have an MA in adult autism, that relates to anxiety, and I have also derived a course particularly for that in mind. Through experience, I have found most people's problems relate to the stress they endure in this modern world we live in. I have therefore decided to create courses of what I do at my centre, online so that it is opened to the rest of the world to access. My courses concentrate on approaching health, wellness, weight loss and youthfulness as well as conquering one's own authenticity and gaining independence through the art of stress management. It's all about conquering challenging emotions before considering food and lifestyle choices. It's a different approach to mental and physical health that deals with our challenges with kindness, love and patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy consultations are for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdult High Functioning Autism - Work/Life Strategies and Stress Management\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor others: Kundalini Yoga Sessions (As part of the consultation)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeditation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStress Management strategies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealthy Eating for weight loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to lose weight intuitively\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am now in the UK. \u0026nbsp;I help people heal through chakra clearing Kundalini yoga, particularly if you have suffered from trauma of some sort. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","firstName":"Katrina","lastName":"Zawawi","photo":{"id":"f94fca60-32c2-4065-b299-b3428c578a78","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[{"id":"9c20a951-2ded-45a5-85d5-11328ccfd7be","type":"3 months","typeName":"THREE_MONTH","amountValue":101.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":3,"order":20},{"id":"b3a8c246-7f74-4473-9e2c-e3b0b91c505e","type":"12 months","typeName":"TWELVE_MONTH","amountValue":551.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":12,"order":40},{"id":"06604f95-32e6-42b7-bd6d-b66171949024","type":"1 month","typeName":"ONE_MONTH","amountValue":51.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":1,"order":10,"preferred":true}]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":21412,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":657,"countAttachments":0},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"FAILED"},"subtitlesLangs":[],"language":{"id":"60094d24883fb20001190fe0","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"enrolled":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","accountId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","slug":"lose-weight-and-get-into-shape-intuitively","topicIds":["7e14ea33-6139-4f1f-adb0-9db52041a8c7"],"subTopicIds":["f24990ca-0504-4a9f-bc5f-ceaaee721f5e"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":1672.5,"rating":0,"rate":99.99,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"7e14ea33-6139-4f1f-adb0-9db52041a8c7","name":"Health and Fitness"},"subTopics":[{"id":"f24990ca-0504-4a9f-bc5f-ceaaee721f5e","name":"Fitness"}],"metrics":{"SEARCH":8633,"CLICK":241,"VIEW":2843,"FEED":16207,"PURCHASE":1},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Katrina Zawawi","courseName":"Lose Weight and get into shape intuitively","courseDescription":"This weight/fat loss course works because many diets and strict exercise regimes don't.\u003cdiv\u003eIt works on the principle that:\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Everyone is determined to begin with, but then the rebellious human nature kicks in during a diet/weight loss programme, even if you are succeeding on it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*I\u0026nbsp;have been on so many diet/exercise regimes and I\u0026nbsp;always manage to gain the weight/fat again.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eStrictness =\u0026nbsp; rebelliousness, after a while.\u0026nbsp; Does this sound familiar to you?\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Worrying about dieting and weight loss itself brings all kinds of stress.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eStress hormones can make you fat and retain the weight you have.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Many exercise regimes don't take into account how the body may feel fatigued. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eEven if your body doesn't feel fatigued, emotionally, you may do - and this can have an impact on weight loss progress.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Following programmes can be tedious and take so much time out of our days, that we dedicate all of our energies to it.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Being on a diet can make us really moody and not fun to be around.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*A drastic change, like a dietary programme and exercise regime can take an emotional toll on the body.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eDoes this all resonate with your experiences of trying to lose weight?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Your'e probably wondering, what makes this programme so different.\u0026nbsp; Well, it's easy really!.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eTherefore, I\u0026nbsp;have created a course where:\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e1.

A lot, let’s take a look. The problem we have when trying to uncover the perfect human diet is that our memories are short.\u0026nbsp;When we think back to our ancestors, we all get pictures of them tending crops, making pieces of bread, or eating rice and other grains, but we are simply not thinking back far enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumans have been growing grains for somewhere around 7,000 years. This seems like a long time, but in evolutionary terms, it is a\u0026nbsp;very short time. Grain eating, especially the incredibly large amounts of carbohydrates we eat today, is a relatively new adaptation for humans. While there are many ways to argue why you shouldn’t be eating grains, there is a very easy experiment you can do in your head that will show you how silly it is that we eat grains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer to that question is:\u0026nbsp;not very long. What allows us to eat grains is that we have brains that are big enough to figure out that grains need to be processed in some form before we eat them. We cannot absorb enough of the nutrients from the grains if we were to simply go out to the field and start eating the raw grains. This isn’t true of fruits, vegetables, and proteins. That means our bodies are not designed to eat grains in the way, say, a cow or goat’s body is designed to digest these foods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrains are the original processed foods, the processing can be as simple as grinding or boiling the grains, but processed they must be before they go in your mouth.

We are told to get 5+ servings of whole grains per day in order to achieve optimum health.

Now, this isn’t such a problem if you have been on a long run or if your a manual laborer as the energy will go into your glycogen stores (muscle) and none will be stored as fat.

The power of your mind is truly amazing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2 - Delay Worrying\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a great and simple tip:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Get a pen and paper\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Write down all the things that are worrying you now\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Tell yourself that you will worry about them later\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mind is a funny thing and for some reason, if you tell it that you will worry about something later it will quite happily put things off.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4 - Have a Release\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the best ways to get things into perspective is to have a release. Too many of us are prone to store up emotions as we have no one to talk to, or are uncomfortable speaking to others about our problems. One way around this is to keep a journal, this is something that is surprisingly helpful. Each night note down things about your day, how you feel (good or bad), and things you're grateful for. You will be shocked at how effective writing a 10-minute journal entry is at clearing your mind and putting it at ease. Journalling helps you to clear your mind and get things off your chest.\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"breaking-the-worry-habit","readTime":2,"coverFile":{"id":"557530e0-4184-4a1c-9ca8-60576af79c1b","type":"atomic:image"},"publishedAt":1611089280225,"modifiedAt":1611089280124,"owner":{"accountId":"5507ec16-6064-4fc6-a57c-227bc7bf81bc","specialistId":"6002e698e1107a0001e64163","slug":"finn-klein","specialistTitle":"Motivation

Even though I make HTML e-mails the default radio button, I find that about 16% of my subscribers select text-only messages. Those who make it a point to select text-only know they need it.

The three types of skin cancer are melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. The latter two are non-melanomas. Melanoma begins in the melanocytes, cells which produce melanin, or the brown pigment in the skin. Melanoma tends to metastasize, or spread, more easily than the other forms of skin cancer, making it more deadly if not caught early on. Basal cell carcinoma grows slowly and rarely metastasizes, while squamous cell carcinoma usually stays in the epidermis but can metastasize. Unhealthy moles are often the best indicators of all three types of skin cancer. Most of us have some sort of brownish spots on our skin in the forms of birthmarks, freckles, and moles, but the majority of these spots are normal and non-cancerous. Learning the ABCs (and D) of skin cancer are crucial when it comes to detecting skin cancer at its earliest stages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA – Asymmetry:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eIf a mole is not round or symmetrical, or one half of the mole is not similar to the other half, it could be a sign of melanoma.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eB – Border Irregularity:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eCancerous moles have irregular borders that may be being uneven, ragged, notched, or blurred.

Melanoma begins in the melanocytes, cells which produce melanin, or the brown pigment in the skin. Melanoma tends to metastasize, or spread, more easily than the other forms of skin cancer, making it more deadly if not caught early on. Basal cell carcinoma grows slowly and rarely metastasizes, while squamous cell carcinoma usually stays in the epidermis but can metastasize. Unhealthy moles are often the best indicators of all three types of skin cancer. Most of us have some sort of brownish spots on our skin in the forms of birthmarks, freckles, and moles, but the majority of these spots are normal and non-cancerous.

Paid marketing strategies can instantly put your product in front of the eyes of potential buyers.  You do not have to start with a lot of money, and I actually recommend that you don’t.  You can start with a small marketing budget of maybe $3-5 per day, and work your way up as your business grows and you start getting more sales.","type":"custom","duration":0,"components":{"blocks":[{"key":"613tm","type":"unstyled","text":"","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"bhep4","type":"atomic","text":" ","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":1,"key":0}],"data":{}},{"key":"3q8vr","type":"unstyled","text":"","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}}],"entityMap":{"0":{"type":"atomic:video","mutability":"IMMUTABLE","data":{"src":"https://grinfer.com/api/storage/files/5761f139-910c-42c6-9236-4577d7579aa4","fileName":"56 Paid Promotion Strategies - Section Overview.mp4"}}}},"attachments":["5761f139-910c-42c6-9236-4577d7579aa4"],"calculated":true,"dataVolume":{"videoDuration":0,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":30,"countAttachments":0}},{"id":"vNbTIrKxKP","title":"Create Mock-Ups for Your Ads | Get High Quality Photo or Video Mockups","description":"In this lecture, I wanted to show you one of my favorite websites to use in order to generate mockups for my T-shirt designs.

Boosted posts can be used in order to create a quick promotion for your products, create brand awareness or gain more followers.  When boosting a post or creating an ad on Facebook, make sure the image does not contain more than 20% text.  If Facebook thinks the image has too much text, they will either reject or suppress your ad from viewers.  Every now and then, I will promote products using boosted posts, but I usually prefer doing this using targeted ads in the business manager.  I like using boosted posts to create engagement, bring more awareness to my brand or gain more follower on my page.","type":"custom","duration":0,"components":{"blocks":[{"key":"brikv","type":"unstyled","text":"","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"8bgc8","type":"atomic","text":" ","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":1,"key":0}],"data":{}},{"key":"531ed","type":"unstyled","text":"","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}}],"entityMap":{"0":{"type":"atomic:video","mutability":"IMMUTABLE","data":{"src":"https://grinfer.com/api/storage/files/a5f64f12-f442-4bc8-b105-f6abbc705fa8","fileName":"58 Facebook Post Boost - Boost Your Facebook Post To Increase Engagement-59.m4v"}}}},"attachments":["a5f64f12-f442-4bc8-b105-f6abbc705fa8"],"calculated":true,"dataVolume":{"videoDuration":0,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":36,"countAttachments":0}},{"id":"ZLgIdOuxEC","title":"Facebook Targeted Ads | Custom Audience \u0026 Targeted Ads","description":"One of the best places to create highly targeted paid ads for your t-shirt designs is Facebook.  In the previous lecture, we went over the process to boost a post in order to create a quick promotion. Facebook provides you with tons of resources and tools to help you reach potential customers.  You can create laser targeted ads to promote your product to your target audience.  In this lecture, we will go over how to use the pixel that we installed on Teespring earlier in the course to create custom audiences, and also how to create highly targeted ads to reach your customer base.  If you already have a ton of followers on your Facebook brand page, I would suggest using Audience Insights on Facebook in order to set the targeting for your ads.  But if you are just getting started, you can use your pixel data to create a lookalike audience that match the same characteristics of the visitors to your online store.  As you create various ad sets and gather customer data over time, you can see what works and what doesn’t, and perfect your ads to get the lowest cost per click.","type":"custom","duration":0,"components":{"blocks":[{"key":"gajv","type":"unstyled","text":"","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"7q644","type":"atomic","text":" ","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[{"offset":0,"length":1,"key":0}],"data":{}},{"key":"ftqfq","type":"unstyled","text":"","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}}],"entityMap":{"0":{"type":"atomic:video","mutability":"IMMUTABLE","data":{"src":"https://grinfer.com/api/storage/files/4fd789bc-0ad7-48fd-8be6-b71fdae63762","fileName":"59 Facebook Targeted Ads - Custom Audience \u0026 Targeted Ads-60.m4v"}}}},"attachments":["4fd789bc-0ad7-48fd-8be6-b71fdae63762"],"calculated":true,"dataVolume":{"videoDuration":0,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":55.714285714285715,"countAttachments":0}},{"id":"rKmLugqYNp","title":"Google Adwords | Create Targeted Ads on Google \u0026 YouTube","description":"Another great platform to create paid ads in order to promote your brand or products is Google Adwords.
