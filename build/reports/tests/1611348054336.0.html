I am a CAMBRIDGE CERTIFIED teacher with six years of teaching experience. i teach IELTS, FCE, PET, KET, Business English, Job Interveiw Preparation and off course Conversational and General English for all levels. A part from my passion for travel and off course teaching English, i also enjoy writing and reading in my free time, particularly about topics that analyse our society and people ... yes i am completely obsessed with TED too, naturally.\n\nMany years ago i decided to live in Italy where i started teaching english in some of the schools in Rome, but i understood straight away that those schools had a terrible defect: \"they all used just one single and repetitive method\" but i believed that every student learnt in a different way.\n\nThat's why i opened my very own school in Rome, where i was finally able to freely teach my students in my own way. This experience allowed me to grow as a teacher, as an entrepreuner but above all as a motivational speaker. Yes, beacuse students must be continuously motivated.\n\nLiving in Italy i learnt first hand what it's like to have to learn another language, therefore my teaching approach is completely based around helping my students overcome the English language jitters and I concentrate on improving confidence and motivation within all my lessons\n\nTeaching gives me huge satisfaction, especially when students thank me after i have helped them pass a job interview, prepare for a work presentation, get a certificate like Cambridge or IELTS, pass a university exam, a contest or to get better marks at school.\n\nOk i think you got the point, so..","firstName":"Gaia Valentina","lastName":"Massara","photo":{"id":"2e98c571-c4a6-440c-ba3c-87f4f544ee9d","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"fbPromotionAvailable":true,"fbLookAlikePromotionAvailable":true,"fbIntroVideoPromotionAvailable":true,"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":9153,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":263,"countAttachments":0},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"COMPLETED"},"subtitlesLangs":[],"language":{"id":"60094d24883fb20001190fe0","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"enrolled":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"3607b94d-4b6d-4761-9a98-391f642f47f6","accountId":"3607b94d-4b6d-4761-9a98-391f642f47f6","slug":"the-complete-english-for-job-interview-course-2019-edition","topicIds":["5408f13c-8541-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa"],"subTopicIds":["97b9c888-9292-4dcf-a302-2b82b70231d0"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":3215.5,"rating":0,"rate":19.99,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"5408f13c-8541-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa","name":"Academics \u0026 Languages"},"subTopics":[{"id":"97b9c888-9292-4dcf-a302-2b82b70231d0","name":"English"}],"metrics":{"SEARCH":7637,"VIEW":5765,"CLICK":293,"FEED":17737,"PURCHASE":4},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Gaia Valentina Massara","courseName":"The Complete English for Job Interview course | 2019 Edition","courseDescription":"Success your job interview in English, improve your confidence, English grammar and answer job interview questions."},{"id":"5d9d78bbb2d9e50001ec7db5","createdAt":1574680895715,"modifiedAt":1609848916892,"version":5279,"payload":{"id":"5d9d78bbb2d9e50001ec7db5","createdAt":1609844311769,"updatedAt":1609848916844,"parentId":"","specialistId":"5d9cbe5db2d9e50001e77884","accountId":"ba72ac84-c0d2-47da-9ba0-163140a44710","topicId":"cf6ab549-1880-45bf-9e94-1b9e9296b08f","subTopicId":"0b9e1c7f-164e-42b5-b8f2-325c40938d93","name":"Adobe Lightroom CC: Landscape Photography Masterclass 2021","slug":"adobe-lightroom-cc-landscape-photography-masterclass-2020","description":"\u003cp\u003eHi, my name is Fabian Rosshirt.

Always hungry to learn and expand his musical knowledge he studied under some of the foremost teachers at the time. \n\nHe spent the 80s honing not only his performance and technical skills but also his teaching abilities.\n\nAs well as performing in various rock bands he started teaching in various schools and academies including Kent County Schools where he was employed as their first contemporary music instructor for the guitar.\n\nIn the late 80s he relocated to London, working in recording studios recording and doing session work during the daytime and playing live in the numerous bars and clubs in the evenings. He also set up his own private teaching company. As his experience working in studios grew he began to record music for advertising and marketing companies, and small radio stations. As well as his teaching role he worked as a session musician recording music for record companies including Virgin Records and Acid Jazz.\n\nIn the 90s he made the bold step of moving to Florida. Where he focused on teaching, working privately and also in schools in the Orlando region. During that time, he was lucky to meet some great musicians that encouraged him to continue his own personal studies and grow his musical knowledge.\n\nAs one who loves to travel and see new places he decided that his next stop would be Panama. A great place to learn Jazz and amazing Latin Rhythm. He really enjoyed his time down there and worked some wonderful bars and clubs. It felt like everyone wanted to learn to play the guitar, young and old.\n\nNext stop was Dubai. Here he focused 100% on teaching. It was actually in Dubai that he started offering Skype Guitar lessons to students based in the Middle East, now he spends more time in front of a computer than he does in the classroom. His love for teaching and exploring new technology means he can bring new and interesting ideas to his lessons.","firstName":"Geoff","lastName":"Sinker","photo":{"id":"ecd46d5a-c4a2-4c39-acae-64b8b5d7ed0b","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[{"id":"8f6c4986-fa70-412a-8e83-3761af6c900c","type":"3 months","typeName":"THREE_MONTH","trialInterval":"DAY","trialIntervalCount":1,"amountValue":61.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":3,"order":20},{"id":"7d476573-1727-4a2c-ab62-16f7170f3dcb","type":"1 month","typeName":"ONE_MONTH","trialInterval":"DAY","trialIntervalCount":1,"amountValue":26.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":1,"order":10},{"id":"eaea0ac4-2a0a-4133-9ea9-c454006b7b7a","type":"1 week","typeName":"ONE_WEEK","trialInterval":"DAY","trialIntervalCount":1,"amountValue":9.99,"interval":"WEEK","intervalCount":1,"order":1,"preferred":true}]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":13577,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":686,"countAttachments":0},"subtitles":{"transcription":{"language":"en","mode":"AUTO","status":"COMPLETED","files":["ae05ac77-7abb-4eeb-a49d-5ea2fee6d8db"],"failures":[]}},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"COMPLETED"},"subtitlesLangs":[{"id":"60094d24883fb20001190fe0","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"}],"language":{"id":"60094d24883fb20001190fe0","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"enrolled":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"d3bc22d8-9517-4608-ac01-d1c8f0d614ba","accountId":"d3bc22d8-9517-4608-ac01-d1c8f0d614ba","slug":"a1-guitar-course-for-the-beginner","topicIds":["5408f13c-8542-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa"],"subTopicIds":["5408f13c-8542-7bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":1879.5,"rating":0,"rate":0,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"sharesaleTextLink":true,"sharesaleBannerID":"1557510","fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"5408f13c-8542-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa","name":"Music"},"subTopics":[{"id":"5408f13c-8542-7bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa","name":"Instruments"}],"metrics":{"CLICK":200,"VIEW":3139,"SEARCH":12975,"PURCHASE":11,"FEED":9847},"promo":false,"fbPromo":false,"sharesalePromo":true,"promoCampaignId":"5ee775bca3c84300015e8a20","promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Geoff Sinker","courseName":"A1 Guitar Course For The Beginner","courseDescription":"Guitar Course For Beginners : Easy to follow lessons, taking you from the Basics to Intermediate Level.\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWelcome to the A1 Guitar Course For Beginners.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf you want to learn the guitar in an easy to follow program then this course is for you!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eGeoff\u0026nbsp; Sinker is a professional guitar teacher with over 30 years of teaching\u0026nbsp; experience working in various music schools around the world.

","specialistOverview":"\u003cp\u003eMy name is Katrina. I have lived studied and worked in the UK for 20 years. I used to be a college lecturer, specialised in adult Autism. I am now back on my home territory of Malaysian Borneo, where I run and own a stress management centre, called 'Whole Life Stress Management'. The aim of my centre is to help people gain better health and control over their lives. At my studio I help individuals on a 121 basis get control over their challenges. This could be helping people manage their weight, conquer physical pain, anxiety and depression. I have an MA in adult autism, that relates to anxiety, and I have also derived a course particularly for that in mind. Through experience, I have found most people's problems relate to the stress they endure in this modern world we live in. I have therefore decided to create courses of what I do at my centre, online so that it is opened to the rest of the world to access. My courses concentrate on approaching health, wellness, weight loss and youthfulness as well as conquering one's own authenticity and gaining independence through the art of stress management. It's all about conquering challenging emotions before considering food and lifestyle choices. It's a different approach to mental and physical health that deals with our challenges with kindness, love and patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy consultations are for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdult High Functioning Autism - Work/Life Strategies and Stress Management\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor others: Kundalini Yoga Sessions (As part of the consultation)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeditation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStress Management strategies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealthy Eating for weight loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to lose weight intuitively\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am now in the UK. \u0026nbsp;I help people heal through chakra clearing Kundalini yoga, particularly if you have suffered from trauma of some sort. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","firstName":"Katrina","lastName":"Zawawi","photo":{"id":"f94fca60-32c2-4065-b299-b3428c578a78","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[{"id":"9c20a951-2ded-45a5-85d5-11328ccfd7be","type":"3 months","typeName":"THREE_MONTH","amountValue":101.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":3,"order":20},{"id":"b3a8c246-7f74-4473-9e2c-e3b0b91c505e","type":"12 months","typeName":"TWELVE_MONTH","amountValue":551.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":12,"order":40},{"id":"06604f95-32e6-42b7-bd6d-b66171949024","type":"1 month","typeName":"ONE_MONTH","amountValue":51.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":1,"order":10,"preferred":true}]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":21412,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":657,"countAttachments":0},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"FAILED"},"subtitlesLangs":[],"language":{"id":"60094d24883fb20001190fe0","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"enrolled":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","accountId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","slug":"lose-weight-and-get-into-shape-intuitively","topicIds":["7e14ea33-6139-4f1f-adb0-9db52041a8c7"],"subTopicIds":["f24990ca-0504-4a9f-bc5f-ceaaee721f5e"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":1672.5,"rating":0,"rate":99.99,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"7e14ea33-6139-4f1f-adb0-9db52041a8c7","name":"Health and Fitness"},"subTopics":[{"id":"f24990ca-0504-4a9f-bc5f-ceaaee721f5e","name":"Fitness"}],"metrics":{"SEARCH":8633,"CLICK":241,"VIEW":2843,"FEED":16207,"PURCHASE":1},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Katrina Zawawi","courseName":"Lose Weight and get into shape intuitively","courseDescription":"This weight/fat loss course works because many diets and strict exercise regimes don't.\u003cdiv\u003eIt works on the principle that:\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Everyone is determined to begin with, but then the rebellious human nature kicks in during a diet/weight loss programme, even if you are succeeding on it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*I\u0026nbsp;have been on so many diet/exercise regimes and I\u0026nbsp;always manage to gain the weight/fat again.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eStrictness =\u0026nbsp; rebelliousness, after a while.\u0026nbsp; Does this sound familiar to you?\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Worrying about dieting and weight loss itself brings all kinds of stress.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eStress hormones can make you fat and retain the weight you have.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Many exercise regimes don't take into account how the body may feel fatigued. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eEven if your body doesn't feel fatigued, emotionally, you may do - and this can have an impact on weight loss progress.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Following programmes can be tedious and take so much time out of our days, that we dedicate all of our energies to it.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Being on a diet can make us really moody and not fun to be around.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*A drastic change, like a dietary programme and exercise regime can take an emotional toll on the body.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eDoes this all resonate with your experiences of trying to lose weight?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Your'e probably wondering, what makes this programme so different.\u0026nbsp; Well, it's easy really!.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eTherefore, I\u0026nbsp;have created a course where:\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e1.

A part from my passion for travel and off course teaching English, i also enjoy writing and reading in my free time, particularly about topics that analyse our society and people ... yes i am completely obsessed with TED too, naturally.\n\nMany years ago i decided to live in Italy where i started teaching english in some of the schools in Rome, but i understood straight away that those schools had a terrible defect: \"they all used just one single and repetitive method\" but i believed that every student learnt in a different way.\n\nThat's why i opened my very own school in Rome, where i was finally able to freely teach my students in my own way. This experience allowed me to grow as a teacher, as an entrepreuner but above all as a motivational speaker. Yes, beacuse students must be continuously motivated.\n\nLiving in Italy i learnt first hand what it's like to have to learn another language, therefore my teaching approach is completely based around helping my students overcome the English language jitters and I concentrate on improving confidence and motivation within all my lessons\n\nTeaching gives me huge satisfaction, especially when students thank me after i have helped them pass a job interview, prepare for a work presentation, get a certificate like Cambridge or IELTS, pass a university exam, a contest or to get better marks at school.\n\nOk i think you got the point, so..","firstName":"Gaia Valentina","lastName":"Massara","photo":{"id":"2e98c571-c4a6-440c-ba3c-87f4f544ee9d","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"fbPromotionAvailable":true,"fbLookAlikePromotionAvailable":true,"fbIntroVideoPromotionAvailable":true,"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":9153,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":263,"countAttachments":0},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"COMPLETED"},"subtitlesLangs":[],"language":{"id":"60094d24883fb20001190fe0","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"enrolled":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"3607b94d-4b6d-4761-9a98-391f642f47f6","accountId":"3607b94d-4b6d-4761-9a98-391f642f47f6","slug":"the-complete-english-for-job-interview-course-2019-edition","topicIds":["5408f13c-8541-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa"],"subTopicIds":["97b9c888-9292-4dcf-a302-2b82b70231d0"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":3215.5,"rating":0,"rate":19.99,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"5408f13c-8541-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa","name":"Academics \u0026 Languages"},"subTopics":[{"id":"97b9c888-9292-4dcf-a302-2b82b70231d0","name":"English"}],"metrics":{"SEARCH":7637,"VIEW":5765,"CLICK":293,"FEED":17737,"PURCHASE":4},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Gaia Valentina Massara","courseName":"The Complete English for Job Interview course | 2019 Edition","courseDescription":"Success your job interview in English, improve your confidence, English grammar and answer job interview questions."},{"id":"5d9d78bbb2d9e50001ec7db5","createdAt":1574680895715,"modifiedAt":1609848916892,"version":5279,"payload":{"id":"5d9d78bbb2d9e50001ec7db5","createdAt":1609844311769,"updatedAt":1609848916844,"parentId":"","specialistId":"5d9cbe5db2d9e50001e77884","accountId":"ba72ac84-c0d2-47da-9ba0-163140a44710","topicId":"cf6ab549-1880-45bf-9e94-1b9e9296b08f","subTopicId":"0b9e1c7f-164e-42b5-b8f2-325c40938d93","name":"Adobe Lightroom CC: Landscape Photography Masterclass 2021","slug":"adobe-lightroom-cc-landscape-photography-masterclass-2020","description":"\u003cp\u003eHi, my name is Fabian Rosshirt.

Always hungry to learn and expand his musical knowledge he studied under some of the foremost teachers at the time. \n\nHe spent the 80s honing not only his performance and technical skills but also his teaching abilities.\n\nAs well as performing in various rock bands he started teaching in various schools and academies including Kent County Schools where he was employed as their first contemporary music instructor for the guitar.\n\nIn the late 80s he relocated to London, working in recording studios recording and doing session work during the daytime and playing live in the numerous bars and clubs in the evenings. He also set up his own private teaching company. As his experience working in studios grew he began to record music for advertising and marketing companies, and small radio stations. As well as his teaching role he worked as a session musician recording music for record companies including Virgin Records and Acid Jazz.\n\nIn the 90s he made the bold step of moving to Florida. Where he focused on teaching, working privately and also in schools in the Orlando region. During that time, he was lucky to meet some great musicians that encouraged him to continue his own personal studies and grow his musical knowledge.\n\nAs one who loves to travel and see new places he decided that his next stop would be Panama. A great place to learn Jazz and amazing Latin Rhythm. He really enjoyed his time down there and worked some wonderful bars and clubs. It felt like everyone wanted to learn to play the guitar, young and old.\n\nNext stop was Dubai. Here he focused 100% on teaching.

","specialistOverview":"\u003cp\u003eMy name is Katrina. I have lived studied and worked in the UK for 20 years. I used to be a college lecturer, specialised in adult Autism. I am now back on my home territory of Malaysian Borneo, where I run and own a stress management centre, called 'Whole Life Stress Management'. The aim of my centre is to help people gain better health and control over their lives. At my studio I help individuals on a 121 basis get control over their challenges. This could be helping people manage their weight, conquer physical pain, anxiety and depression. I have an MA in adult autism, that relates to anxiety, and I have also derived a course particularly for that in mind. Through experience, I have found most people's problems relate to the stress they endure in this modern world we live in. I have therefore decided to create courses of what I do at my centre, online so that it is opened to the rest of the world to access. My courses concentrate on approaching health, wellness, weight loss and youthfulness as well as conquering one's own authenticity and gaining independence through the art of stress management. It's all about conquering challenging emotions before considering food and lifestyle choices. It's a different approach to mental and physical health that deals with our challenges with kindness, love and patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy consultations are for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdult High Functioning Autism - Work/Life Strategies and Stress Management\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor others: Kundalini Yoga Sessions (As part of the consultation)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeditation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStress Management strategies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealthy Eating for weight loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to lose weight intuitively\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am now in the UK. \u0026nbsp;I help people heal through chakra clearing Kundalini yoga, particularly if you have suffered from trauma of some sort. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","firstName":"Katrina","lastName":"Zawawi","photo":{"id":"f94fca60-32c2-4065-b299-b3428c578a78","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[{"id":"9c20a951-2ded-45a5-85d5-11328ccfd7be","type":"3 months","typeName":"THREE_MONTH","amountValue":101.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":3,"order":20},{"id":"b3a8c246-7f74-4473-9e2c-e3b0b91c505e","type":"12 months","typeName":"TWELVE_MONTH","amountValue":551.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":12,"order":40},{"id":"06604f95-32e6-42b7-bd6d-b66171949024","type":"1 month","typeName":"ONE_MONTH","amountValue":51.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":1,"order":10,"preferred":true}]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":21412,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":657,"countAttachments":0},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"FAILED"},"subtitlesLangs":[],"language":{"id":"60094d24883fb20001190fe0","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"enrolled":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","accountId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","slug":"lose-weight-and-get-into-shape-intuitively","topicIds":["7e14ea33-6139-4f1f-adb0-9db52041a8c7"],"subTopicIds":["f24990ca-0504-4a9f-bc5f-ceaaee721f5e"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":1672.5,"rating":0,"rate":99.99,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"7e14ea33-6139-4f1f-adb0-9db52041a8c7","name":"Health and Fitness"},"subTopics":[{"id":"f24990ca-0504-4a9f-bc5f-ceaaee721f5e","name":"Fitness"}],"metrics":{"SEARCH":8633,"CLICK":241,"VIEW":2843,"FEED":16207,"PURCHASE":1},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Katrina Zawawi","courseName":"Lose Weight and get into shape intuitively","courseDescription":"This weight/fat loss course works because many diets and strict exercise regimes don't.\u003cdiv\u003eIt works on the principle that:\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Everyone is determined to begin with, but then the rebellious human nature kicks in during a diet/weight loss programme, even if you are succeeding on it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*I\u0026nbsp;have been on so many diet/exercise regimes and I\u0026nbsp;always manage to gain the weight/fat again.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eStrictness =\u0026nbsp; rebelliousness, after a while.\u0026nbsp; Does this sound familiar to you?\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Worrying about dieting and weight loss itself brings all kinds of stress.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eStress hormones can make you fat and retain the weight you have.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Many exercise regimes don't take into account how the body may feel fatigued. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eEven if your body doesn't feel fatigued, emotionally, you may do - and this can have an impact on weight loss progress.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Following programmes can be tedious and take so much time out of our days, that we dedicate all of our energies to it.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Being on a diet can make us really moody and not fun to be around.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*A drastic change, like a dietary programme and exercise regime can take an emotional toll on the body.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eDoes this all resonate with your experiences of trying to lose weight?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Your'e probably wondering, what makes this programme so different.\u0026nbsp; Well, it's easy really!.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eTherefore, I\u0026nbsp;have created a course where:\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e1.

A lot, let’s take a look. The problem we have when trying to uncover the perfect human diet is that our memories are short.\u0026nbsp;When we think back to our ancestors, we all get pictures of them tending crops, making pieces of bread, or eating rice and other grains, but we are simply not thinking back far enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumans have been growing grains for somewhere around 7,000 years. This seems like a long time, but in evolutionary terms, it is a\u0026nbsp;very short time. Grain eating, especially the incredibly large amounts of carbohydrates we eat today, is a relatively new adaptation for humans. While there are many ways to argue why you shouldn’t be eating grains, there is a very easy experiment you can do in your head that will show you how silly it is that we eat grains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer to that question is:\u0026nbsp;not very long. What allows us to eat grains is that we have brains that are big enough to figure out that grains need to be processed in some form before we eat them. We cannot absorb enough of the nutrients from the grains if we were to simply go out to the field and start eating the raw grains. This isn’t true of fruits, vegetables, and proteins. That means our bodies are not designed to eat grains in the way, say, a cow or goat’s body is designed to digest these foods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrains are the original processed foods, the processing can be as simple as grinding or boiling the grains, but processed they must be before they go in your mouth.

We are told to get 5+ servings of whole grains per day in order to achieve optimum health.

Now, this isn’t such a problem if you have been on a long run or if your a manual laborer as the energy will go into your glycogen stores (muscle) and none will be stored as fat.

Too many of us are prone to store up emotions as we have no one to talk to, or are uncomfortable speaking to others about our problems. One way around this is to keep a journal, this is something that is surprisingly helpful. Each night note down things about your day, how you feel (good or bad), and things you're grateful for. You will be shocked at how effective writing a 10-minute journal entry is at clearing your mind and putting it at ease. Journalling helps you to clear your mind and get things off your chest.\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"breaking-the-worry-habit","readTime":2,"coverFile":{"id":"557530e0-4184-4a1c-9ca8-60576af79c1b","type":"atomic:image"},"publishedAt":1611089280225,"modifiedAt":1611089280124,"owner":{"accountId":"5507ec16-6064-4fc6-a57c-227bc7bf81bc","specialistId":"6002e698e1107a0001e64163","slug":"finn-klein","specialistTitle":"Motivation Coach","specialistOverview":"","firstName":"Finn","lastName":"Klein","photo":{"id":"dade3414-5b6e-4961-852a-6c57e35487ec","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[]},"bySubscription":false,"topicIds":["674f9886-b68e-46e7-b94b-a78fcd42f5d1"],"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED"},"attachments":["557530e0-4184-4a1c-9ca8-60576af79c1b"],"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":0,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":145,"countAttachments":0}},"type":"STORY","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"5507ec16-6064-4fc6-a57c-227bc7bf81bc","accountId":"5507ec16-6064-4fc6-a57c-227bc7bf81bc","slug":"breaking-the-worry-habit","topicIds":["674f9886-b68e-46e7-b94b-a78fcd42f5d1"],"relevanceScore":1,"rating":0,"rate":0,"hasSubscription":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"metrics":{"CLICK":1},"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Finn Klein","title":"Breaking the worry habit","shortDescription":"You will learn some cool tips and tricks which can help your mind realize that worrying is irrational and a total waste of time."}],"initial":false,"total":703},"STORY_FEED":{"loading":true,"result":[],"initial":false,"total":0},"STORY":{"loading":true,"result":[],"initial":false,"total":0}}},"storiesState":{"tableStories":{"isLoading":false,"stories":[],"pageNumber":0,"total":0},"currentStory":{"data":{"id":"600af2065c6eaf0001540d10","createdAt":1611330054725,"updatedAt":1611340826438,"accountId":"c96ed65e-160c-45d2-9843-73e4cc5851b6","specialistId":"600ae2ca5c6eaf0001540cd1","status":"APPROVED","title":"Get the most out of your workout","shortDescription":"Check out this blog post to learn some great tips on how to update your daily workout and make the most of it!

As a result Bhutan Telecom suddenly faced competition from another Operator called \u003ca href=\"http://www.tashicell.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTashi Cell\u003c/a\u003e. Now, Bhutan has a total population of 600,000 people and Bhutan Telecom had about 300,000 subscribers across \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_telephony\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emobile\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_line_telephone\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efixed\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadband\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebroadband\u003c/a\u003e services. After deliberations, we came to the conclusion that we could not help Bhutan Telecom increase its Customer Base drastically and we could not prevent the natural churn. So, we thought of working on 2 dimensions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first dimension was that we would optimise the organisation (in the words of CEO of Bhutan Telecom, “\u003cstrong\u003ehe wanted a sleek organisation with no fat\u003c/strong\u003e“). To do this, we executed a plan over 3 phases to converge all the technologies and business segments. This drastically increased agility and drastically reduced fat. Of course, we optimised aspects like inventory use, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe second dimension was that we should have new products. For this, we devised a product called \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_money\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMobile Money\u003c/a\u003e (I got this idea from my interactions with \u003ca href=\"http://www.safaricom.co.ke/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSafaricom\u003c/a\u003e in \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKenya\u003c/a\u003e to whom we were trying to sell our Billing System. Safaricom had implemented \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-Pesa\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003em-Pesa\u003c/a\u003e). Now, the idea was that we would make all payments through the Mobile Phone. We would pay \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eElectricity\u003c/a\u003e Bills, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWater\u003c/a\u003e Bills, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTax\u003c/a\u003ees, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insurance\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInsurance\u003c/a\u003e, etc. and pay for buying \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eshoe\u003c/a\u003es, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclothes\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erice\u003c/a\u003e, etc. The first dimension of this plan was relatively easy as we engaged with the Electricity Companies, Water Corporations, etc. We had only one hurdle as how we would divide the cost between the corporations for this service. To resolve this, we got in touch with the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minister_(government)\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMinister\u003c/a\u003e of \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInformation and Technology\u003c/a\u003e of Bhutan. The Minister converted the idea in to a plan for increasing GNH (Bhutan is the only country in the world which measures its economy in terms of \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_National_Happiness\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGross National Happiness\u003c/a\u003e). We found that an average Bhutanese walked for 3 days to pay his/her electricity bill and then walked back for 3 days. If he/she could pay his/her bills through the Mobile Phones, the Government would save 6 days of labour for the citizen. Now, all the Corporations had no choice but to comply.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere was another hurdle and that was the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBank\u003c/a\u003es. In Bhutan, there is no \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_Card\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCredit Card\u003c/a\u003es. Also, Banks have a coverage of 20% of the territory as compared to 60% coverage of the Telecom sector. So, the Banks, instead of posing competition, actually joined hands as they saw this as a very good opportunity for increasing their business. Banks had found that people in the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Village\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evillage\u003c/a\u003es had more cash than the people in the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecities\u003c/a\u003e. This was because in the villages, people earned less; but spent so less that the savings was high. In cities, people earned much more and spend most of it. And covering the villages was a major challenge for the Banks given the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elandscape\u003c/a\u003e of Bhutan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, when everything was put in place, we had the challenge for making the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voucher\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evoucher\u003c/a\u003es available in the villages. And also we had the challenge for collecting the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emoney\u003c/a\u003e from the villages. Here, the Government came to the rescue. Bhutan Government had set up a body called \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCitizen\u003c/a\u003e Convenience Center. This body had a presence in almost all villages and cities. So, it was decided that the CCC would supply the vouchers and collect the money.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter all this, one would ask why there is no Mobile-Money in Bhutan. The whole project was brought to a halt when the Monetary Controller of Bhutan said that they could not allow any other body, other than themselves, to create money in Bhutan.

Right at that time, Debashis resigned. Avishek had been working with the system for about 2 months. So, I inspected the system and realized that while the core functions of generation of TAP files and uploading of incoming TAP files worked fine, the system had very little amount of configurability and the user interface was not something great (The \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_rating\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Telecommunications Rating\"\u003erating function\u003c/a\u003e was handled by GABS and the \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation_function\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mediation function\"\u003eMediation function\u003c/a\u003e was handled by Fulcrum in our solution, while Dialog provided us with rated roaming CDRs from CCBS). Also, the code set for Dialog was different from the other 3 installations. Also, the core TAP code having undergone so many changes that it was a piece of Maggi. Now, I definitely wanted to make the system more configurable and improve the \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Graphical user interface\"\u003eGUI\u003c/a\u003e. This apart I wanted 2 adaptors which could be used to plug the system to any \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_billing\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Telecommunications Billing\"\u003eBilling System\u003c/a\u003e without having to change any internals. To do so, I realized that I needed to also change the core TAP generator and TAP Loader as they would need integrating with the Configurator and execution GUI and the adaptors. I calculated from the value of the order that I could deliver about 25% EBIT on the project if I redeveloped the system from the scratch. So, I procured the \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASN.1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ASN.1\"\u003eASN.1\u003c/a\u003e license from \u003ca href=\"http://www.obj-sys.com/index.php\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Objective Systems\"\u003eObjective System\u003c/a\u003e for \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio_.NET\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Microsoft Visual Studio .Net\"\u003e.Net\u003c/a\u003e and set about writing the \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Software\"\u003esoftware\u003c/a\u003e. At that time, we were also developing the \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Packet_Radio_Service\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"General Packet Radio Service\"\u003eGPRS\u003c/a\u003e Billing solution for Reliance apart from some small changes for Bhutan Telecom.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs TAP Generation and Loading was primarily a batch function, I needed a \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_processing\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Batch processing\"\u003ebatch processing\u003c/a\u003e engine and we had a software called Hungry Jack which could serve this purpose. However, I found that Hungry Jack was not entirely suitable for any batch processing jobs and was more suitable for report generation. So, first I decided to develop a batch processing engine. Thus, was born Gentle Jill. It was designed as a batch processing engine to which any batch process could be plugged in by configuring the same using the GUI of Gentle Jill. Also, Gentle Jill was a \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiprocessing\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Multiprocessing\"\u003emulti-processing system\u003c/a\u003e which could be \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Scalability\"\u003escaled up and scaled down\u003c/a\u003e depending on the capacity of the machine where it was installed. As I developed Gentle Jill, I was more and more thrilled with the outcome and ambitions for the same started to grow. Once the core engine was ready and functional, I discovered \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Management_Instrumentation\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Windows Management Instrumentation\"\u003eWMI\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_library\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Software Library\"\u003elibrary \u003c/a\u003eand plugged in features for preventing breakdown of Gentle Jill due to any environmental conditions. I got Gentle Jill tested in Reliance as I included it as the core engine for running the GPRS Rating Engine which was developed by \u003ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=144425380\u0026amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH\u0026amp;authToken=Uwuu\u0026amp;locale=en_US\u0026amp;srchid=4acb25ac-a1bc-4381-8ac7-30977de6fa21-0\u0026amp;srchindex=1\u0026amp;srchtotal=21\u0026amp;goback=%2Efps_PBCK_anuj+roy_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*2_*1_Y_*1_*1_*1_false_1_R_*1_*51_*1_*51_true_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2\u0026amp;pvs=ps\u0026amp;trk=pp_profile_name_link\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Anuj Kumar Roy\"\u003eAnuj\u003c/a\u003e. However, developing Gentle Jill had eaten up fair part of the time for the development of the TAP solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith six weeks to go for the delivery, I started to develop the TAP Generator. At that moment, the GPRS deployment at Reliance just went live. As was the case with Reliance, there were many problems and this took up a lot of my time. In spite of the same, I developed the TAP Generator within 2 weeks as I had to just program for generation of one TAP file. Gentle Jill would take care of using this program for generating any number of TAP files for any set of parameters which could be set for the same. In the meanwhile, Avishek and \u003ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=73641574\u0026amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH\u0026amp;authToken=mYL8\u0026amp;locale=en_US\u0026amp;srchid=f4324cea-ff22-4657-862d-1f701927f813-0\u0026amp;srchindex=1\u0026amp;srchtotal=9\u0026amp;goback=%2Efps_PBCK_Sovan+mukherjee_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*2_*1_Y_*1_*1_*1_false_1_R_*1_*51_*1_*51_true_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2\u0026amp;pvs=ps\u0026amp;trk=pp_profile_name_link\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sovan Mukherjee\"\u003eSovan\u003c/a\u003e with the help of Anuj had developed the Configurator and the Executor \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface\" rel=\"wikipedia\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"User interface\"\u003eWeb Interfaces\u003c/a\u003e besides the adaptors for CCBS. Also, Sovan developed the High Usage Report per FF04. I decided that we would not supply the RAP function as it was anyway not used in Dialog. So, I submitted this part of the software for testing with the understanding with the \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_Assurance\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Quality Assurance\"\u003eQuality Assurance\u003c/a\u003e Team that the TAP Loader would be supplied while they completed testing this scope.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I started to develop the TAP Loader, I realised that it would be better if I had a general purpose file up-loader program. So, I developed another member in the Gentle Jill family and called it Gentle Fanny. Gentle Fanny could be configured to watch a directory and upload files when any new file was deposited there. Gentle Fanny would pick up an incoming TAP file and submit it to Gentle Jill for processing. This took up another 2 weeks. By this time, disturbance from Reliance had reached a peak. I strategize that to be able to deliver the Dialog project on time, I needed to get away from \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolkata\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kolkata\"\u003eKolkata\u003c/a\u003e, away from Reliance. So, I decided to go over to Sri Lanka and complete the TAP Loader part violating the contract with the Quality Assurance team. The plan was that by the time Dialog completed conducting user acceptance for the TAP Generator, I would complete the TAP Loader.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe, Avishek and I, arrived in Sri Lanka on a Sunday and we were met in \u003ca href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g293962-d306381-Reviews-Ramada_Colombo-Colombo.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ramada, Colombo\"\u003eHoliday Inn\u003c/a\u003e by \u003ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=18074322\u0026amp;locale=en_US\u0026amp;trk=tyah\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nishad Majeed\"\u003eNishad\u003c/a\u003e, the Manager for Roaming Billing in Dialog. Avishek knew Nishad from before as I had sent him to Dialog once for support on the existing system while we were developing the new system. Nishad used to call him younger brother. For me, it was the first time I was meeting him face to face, though we had interacted over phone many times. Nishad is a tall and well-built person and he is extremely friendly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext day, we went over to Dialog office and soon were given the machine for the deployment. Avishek got down to work on the installing the software and making the needed changes for integrating the installation to the CCBS Billing System. I got down to writing the TAP Loader. No sooner had I done so, I got a call from Reliance and took a long time to explain and calm them down. This continues unabated. No sooner I got down write the TAP Loader, I would receive a call from Reliance. As Reliance was such an important customer, I could not refuse any of the calls as well. In any case, I never turned down any calls from any of our customers. So, this was a huge issue. Anyway, I used the evenings through nights to write the TAP Loader. The Dialog IT Team members possibly sympathized with us, as from the day 1 we were leaving office at around 2 or 3 in the morning and coming back by 8 AM next morning. They would arrange for nice food every night and we would all get together and have a wonderful dinner. Seeing me work like this, Nishad understood that the software was not ready. However, he did not say anything to me. What he told internally to his management is not known to me. However, nobody from Dialog ever questioned me about this or ever escalated to my management. Also, Nishad would stay with us in the office till we were there and drop us to our Hotel before going home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFrom the 3rd day, we were ready to generate the TAP files and send them to the Data Clearing House for \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation_(software)\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Verification and Validation (Software)\"\u003evalidation\u003c/a\u003e. Nishad took over this action as this was the main \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceptance_testing\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Acceptance Testing\"\u003eAcceptance Criteria\u003c/a\u003e. Avishek, in this process, also started to teach him how to use the new system. TAP Loader was still getting ready and I realized it would take time as I was getting so little time to develop it as I had to attend to calls from Reliance. Then, came the big blow when \u003ca href=\"http://www.mach.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MACH\"\u003eMach\u003c/a\u003e returned all our TAP files with a number of errors. Studying the errors, I realized that everything was minor except for 2 errors whereby Mach could not interpret the \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSISDN\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"MSISDN\"\u003eMSISDN\u003c/a\u003e (the mobile number) and the \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMSI\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"IMSI\"\u003eIMSI\u003c/a\u003e (the most essential data for Roaming Billing). Now, I checked the TAP Generator and fixed the issues and found that there was nothing wrong in the code for encoding the MSISDN and IMSI. However, the next day, Mach again sent errors and MSISDN \u0026amp; IMSI errors were prominent. I left the work on the TAP Loader and fully focused on fixing the errors from TAP Generator. However, I was totally foxed as I could not find any error in the code for errors reported on MSISDN and IMSI encoding. After 3 rounds of rejection, I decided to write to Objective Systems for their help. Eathan Metsger was the support staff from Objective System. He suggested some changes and these did not work as well. Ultimately, I decided to send him a whole bunch of generated TAP files along with the code and raw data for inspection. The next day, Eathan came back telling me that there was a bug in the ASN.1 compiler and he would send the fix the next day. This was a huge relief. However, by the time, we had already used up more than one and half weeks of my two weeks stay and TAP Loader was nowhere near ready. So, I requested my boss to extend my stay by one week. With lot of reluctance and after a lot of explanation, he approved the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI calculated that I could still finish the TAP Loader by the end of the 2nd week of stay and then would it hand over to Nishad for testing. Further, I planned that as we had one extra week in Sri Lanka and we had worked on all days including the Saturdays \u0026amp; Sundays for more than 15 hours per day, we would take 1 day off and go to \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galle\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Galle\"\u003eGalle \u003c/a\u003eon Saturday of the third week and then return back to \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"India\"\u003eIndia\u003c/a\u003e on Sunday. While I continued developing the TAP Loader, the fix came from Eathan and we again compiled our TAP Generator and sent files to Mach for verification. This time they came back clean and Nishad took over to verify the rest of the aspects. I completed the TAP Loader on the Friday of the 2nd week and tested it thoroughly myself and sent it to Sovan \u0026amp; Anuj to test in Kolkata. Also, I engaged Avishek to test the TAP Loader on Saturday and Sunday. While they were testing, I went out into the \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Colombo\"\u003eColombo\u003c/a\u003e city and found \u003ca href=\"http://www.odel.lk/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ODEL\"\u003eOdel\u003c/a\u003e close to the Dialog office. I spent some time there and ended up buying a lot of stuff. So much I purchased on the first day that on Sunday, I had to also buy a new suitcase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNishad started to test the TAP Loader on Monday and he took his time. It was on Wednesday night that we decided to install the software in production on Thursday morning. We did so and as a result, now it was not possible for us to go to Galle anymore as we could not take a chance. Nishad made a demand that Avishek should stay for more 3 weeks to support the system from on site and I readily agreed though I knew very well that this would need another round of explanation and negotiation with my boss. On Thursday, I completed getting my boss’s approval for Avishek’s stay extension and on Friday evening, we sent our first lot of TAP files generated by the new system to Mach for dispatching to the partners of Dialog. There were no alarms on Saturday and Nishad took us around Colombo for shopping. I purchased a several items from the Handicraft Emporium. Saturday evening, we got the feedback from Mach reporting some errors. This was a surprise as I had to catch the return flight at 6 AM on Monday. Also, on Saturday, very near the Dialog Office, there was a bomb blast in which the extremists had tried to assassinate the Defence Minister. The \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotabhaya_Rajapaksa\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Gotabhaya Rajapaksa\"\u003eDefence Minister\u003c/a\u003e escaped the attempt. I was a bit jolted. However, I came back to work on Sunday early morning to fix the issues. I fixed the issues and again we sent the files to Mach. Nishad got in touch with his counterparts in Mach and asked for a speedy feedback within the same day and Mach said they would try. We finally got a reply from Mach at about 10 PM and everything was okay. So, now I could go back to Kolkata as scheduled. I invited Nishad and his colleagues from Dialog, with whom we had spent so many several hours during the 3 weeks, to dinner at Holiday Inn. They agreed and we had a gala time till around 2 AM. Then I returned to my room and packed my luggage with the help of Avishek and started off for the Airport at around 3 AM. So, all I had seen of Sri Lanka was Holiday Inn and Dialog office and Odel and the Handicraft Emporium and the food court where we used to go for lunch every day. I did not even get to know that the sea was just 200m away from Holiday Inn in the opposite direction to my daily route to Dialog Office.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI reached the \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo_Airport\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Colombo Airport\"\u003eAirport \u003c/a\u003eat around 4 AM and found that it was jam-packed. With lot of effort, I got past the security check. When I reached the check in counter, I was told that the flight was full and I would have to wait for them to get back to me. I was surprised as I had a confirmed ticket. Then I realized that due to the bomb blast, lots of people, especially foreigners, were trying to get out of Colombo. Realising this, I quickly approached a \u003ca href=\"http://www.srilankan.com/en_uk/ru\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sri Lankan Airlines\"\u003eSri Lankan Airlines\u003c/a\u003e officer and pleaded him to the best of my ability with the best of reasons that I could imagine including how sick my wife was and how important it was for me to get back to her, etc. For whatever, reason, the officer took pity on me and asked the check-in counter staff to check me in. Soon I was on the flight on my way back to Kolkata via \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chennai\"\u003eChennai\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn returning to India, \u003ca href=\"http://www.vodafone.in/pages/index.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Vodafone\"\u003eVodafone\u003c/a\u003e called me and told me that my mobile bill was Rs. 86,400. I told them that my connection was a corporate connection and thus it was most important for me to keep in touch with the customers using this number and thus they should not disconnect the line. I also told them that Siemens would give me the amount when I submitted the tour claim and I would settle the amount. They agreed and increased my \u003ca href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_limit\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Credit Limit\"\u003ecredit limit\u003c/a\u003e to Rs. 1,00,000. I then realize how expensive it was for me to go on tours leaving Reliance in Kolkata. When I submitted the tour claim, I was in for another surprise as it was not possible for anyone to approve the telephone expenses as it was beyond the documented norms of the company. I requested my General Manager and he assured me that he would help. In the meanwhile, I kept paying Vodafone the remaining months bills and not settling this amount. After 2 months of return from Sri Lanka, I got a call from a stranger asking all sorts of details about where I stay and what I do, etc. These calls repeated often and after some time this got me worried as I realized that these were agents employed by Vodafone to realize their Rs. 86,400. \u003ca href=\"http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/en/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Siemens\"\u003eSiemens\u003c/a\u003e took 3 months to reimburse the amount and immediately I paid Vodafone and was relieved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere were no major hiccups with the supplied software and Avishek came back after 3 weeks as we had planned. We had generated an EBIT of 20% on the project and the Annual Maintenance Contract was renewed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, I now went to Reliance and told them to upgrade to TAP 3.11 as they had also launched GPRS services. It was relatively easy (considering other deals with Reliance) as they decided to buy the upgrade. We quoted a higher price than what we had quoted Dialog and Reliance agreed. However, this time, all I had to do was to deploy Avishek and Sovan for 4 weeks and Reliance was up and running on TAP 3.11. Though we also supplied the RAP feature, Reliance never used the same. Another important aspect was that the Reliance Delivery was fully certified by the Quality Assurance Department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the meanwhile, I was in discussion with Bhutan Telecom for the upgrade and they also agreed. We quoted an even higher price and the deal was done. This time, I sent Sovan to Bhutan for 3 weeks and Bhutan Telecom was up and running on TAP 3.11.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, I got in touch with Africell for the TAP 3.11 upgrade and they also agreed. As nobody from Siemens had gone to Africell for many years, I decided to go to Gambia to implement the new TAP system and to pay a courtesy visit to them and to search for new business. My boss approved a 2 weeks stay in Gambia for the implementation. However, I had to negotiate a one week extension and completed the implementation in 3 weeks. It was another great customer that I met in Gambia and that was \u003ca href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=6092829\u0026amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH\u0026amp;authToken=D5tu\u0026amp;locale=en_US\u0026amp;srchid=e191c95a-ab1d-4e91-b5c5-7013f9f83db0-0\u0026amp;srchindex=1\u0026amp;srchtotal=1\u0026amp;goback=%2Efps_PBCK_Riad+halwani_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*2_*1_Y_*1_*1_*1_false_1_R_*1_*51_*1_*51_true_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2_*2\u0026amp;pvs=ps\u0026amp;trk=pp_profile_name_link\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Riad Halwani\"\u003eRiad\u003c/a\u003e.

However, the fact remained that from 2006 till 2010 (I left Siemens on 31May10), Gentle Jill was a part of all our solutions and this software did not undergo any change in the code and did not need any maintenance.

However, I used to be surprised that for most of the customer requirements, they used to compile the code and send a fresh executable which customers would install and use.","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[{"offset":4,"length":7,"key":0},{"offset":45,"length":8,"key":1},{"offset":67,"length":14,"key":2},{"offset":83,"length":8,"key":3},{"offset":93,"length":6,"key":4},{"offset":105,"length":15,"key":5},{"offset":121,"length":9,"key":6},{"offset":161,"length":3,"key":7},{"offset":184,"length":6,"key":8},{"offset":236,"length":17,"key":9},{"offset":483,"length":7,"key":10},{"offset":744,"length":10,"key":11},{"offset":777,"length":7,"key":12}],"data":{}},{"key":"6e2at","type":"unstyled","text":"","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"6gmfb","type":"unstyled","text":"Dialog gave us the order for the upgrade of the solution to implement TAP 3.11 as they were at that time launching their 3G network. Right at that time, Debashis resigned. Avishek had been working with the system for about 2 months. So, I inspected the system and realized that while the core functions of generation of TAP files and uploading of incoming TAP files worked fine, the system had very little amount of configurability and the user interface was not something great (The rating function was handled by GABS and the Mediation function was handled by Fulcrum in our solution, while Dialog provided us with rated roaming CDRs from CCBS). Also, the code set for Dialog was different from the other 3 installations. Also, the core TAP code having undergone so many changes that it was a piece of Maggi. Now, I definitely wanted to make the system more configurable and improve the GUI. This apart I wanted 2 adaptors which could be used to plug the system to any Billing System without having to change any internals. To do so, I realized that I needed to also change the core TAP generator and TAP Loader as they would need integrating with the Configurator and execution GUI and the adaptors. I calculated from the value of the order that I could deliver about 25% EBIT on the project if I redeveloped the system from the scratch. So, I procured the ASN.1 license from Objective System for .Net and set about writing the software. At that time, we were also developing the GPRS Billing solution for Reliance apart from some small changes for Bhutan Telecom.","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[{"offset":33,"length":7,"key":13},{"offset":121,"length":2,"key":14},{"offset":484,"length":15,"key":15},{"offset":528,"length":18,"key":16},{"offset":889,"length":3,"key":17},{"offset":971,"length":14,"key":18},{"offset":1360,"length":5,"key":19},{"offset":1379,"length":16,"key":20},{"offset":1400,"length":4,"key":21},{"offset":1431,"length":8,"key":22},{"offset":1483,"length":4,"key":23}],"data":{}},{"key":"8an46","type":"unstyled","text":"","depth":0,"inlineStyleRanges":[],"entityRanges":[],"data":{}},{"key":"854qm","type":"unstyled","text":"As TAP Generation and Loading was primarily a batch function, I needed a batch processing engine and we had a software called Hungry Jack which could serve this purpose.

Thus, was born Gentle Jill. It was designed as a batch processing engine to which any batch process could be plugged in by configuring the same using the GUI of Gentle Jill. Also, Gentle Jill was a multi-processing system which could be scaled up and scaled down depending on the capacity of the machine where it was installed. As I developed Gentle Jill, I was more and more thrilled with the outcome and ambitions for the same started to grow. Once the core engine was ready and functional, I discovered WMI library and plugged in features for preventing breakdown of Gentle Jill due to any environmental conditions.

Gentle Jill would take care of using this program for generating any number of TAP files for any set of parameters which could be set for the same.

Gentle Fanny would pick up an incoming TAP file and submit it to Gentle Jill for processing. This took up another 2 weeks. By this time, disturbance from Reliance had reached a peak. I strategize that to be able to deliver the Dialog project on time, I needed to get away from Kolkata, away from Reliance.

No sooner I got down write the TAP Loader, I would receive a call from Reliance. As Reliance was such an important customer, I could not refuse any of the calls as well. In any case, I never turned down any calls from any of our customers. So, this was a huge issue. Anyway, I used the evenings through nights to write the TAP Loader. The Dialog IT Team members possibly sympathized with us, as from the day 1 we were leaving office at around 2 or 3 in the morning and coming back by 8 AM next morning. They would arrange for nice food every night and we would all get together and have a wonderful dinner. Seeing me work like this, Nishad understood that the software was not ready. However, he did not say anything to me. What he told internally to his management is not known to me. However, nobody from Dialog ever questioned me about this or ever escalated to my management.

TAP Loader was still getting ready and I realized it would take time as I was getting so little time to develop it as I had to attend to calls from Reliance. Then, came the big blow when Mach returned all our TAP files with a number of errors. Studying the errors, I realized that everything was minor except for 2 errors whereby Mach could not interpret the MSISDN (the mobile number) and the IMSI (the most essential data for Roaming Billing). Now, I checked the TAP Generator and fixed the issues and found that there was nothing wrong in the code for encoding the MSISDN and IMSI. However, the next day, Mach again sent errors and MSISDN \u0026 IMSI errors were prominent. I left the work on the TAP Loader and fully focused on fixing the errors from TAP Generator. However, I was totally foxed as I could not find any error in the code for errors reported on MSISDN and IMSI encoding. After 3 rounds of rejection, I decided to write to Objective Systems for their help. Eathan Metsger was the support staff from Objective System. He suggested some changes and these did not work as well. Ultimately, I decided to send him a whole bunch of generated TAP files along with the code and raw data for inspection. The next day, Eathan came back telling me that there was a bug in the ASN.1 compiler and he would send the fix the next day. This was a huge relief. However, by the time, we had already used up more than one and half weeks of my two weeks stay and TAP Loader was nowhere near ready. So, I requested my boss to extend my stay by one week.

While I continued developing the TAP Loader, the fix came from Eathan and we again compiled our TAP Generator and sent files to Mach for verification. This time they came back clean and Nishad took over to verify the rest of the aspects. I completed the TAP Loader on the Friday of the 2nd week and tested it thoroughly myself and sent it to Sovan \u0026 Anuj to test in Kolkata. Also, I engaged Avishek to test the TAP Loader on Saturday and Sunday. While they were testing, I went out into the Colombo city and found Odel close to the Dialog office.

Nishad made a demand that Avishek should stay for more 3 weeks to support the system from on site and I readily agreed though I knew very well that this would need another round of explanation and negotiation with my boss. On Thursday, I completed getting my boss’s approval for Avishek’s stay extension and on Friday evening, we sent our first lot of TAP files generated by the new system to Mach for dispatching to the partners of Dialog. There were no alarms on Saturday and Nishad took us around Colombo for shopping. I purchased a several items from the Handicraft Emporium. Saturday evening, we got the feedback from Mach reporting some errors. This was a surprise as I had to catch the return flight at 6 AM on Monday. Also, on Saturday, very near the Dialog Office, there was a bomb blast in which the extremists had tried to assassinate the Defence Minister. The Defence Minister escaped the attempt. I was a bit jolted. However, I came back to work on Sunday early morning to fix the issues. I fixed the issues and again we sent the files to Mach. Nishad got in touch with his counterparts in Mach and asked for a speedy feedback within the same day and Mach said they would try.

He is the original, and most recognised Kundalini Yoga teacher, serving the South West of England, UK.\n\n'Kundalini Dance' : Mark is a fully trained and certified teacher since 2005, with Leyolah Antara, in Byron Bay, Australia.He is the original, and most experienced Kundalini Dance teacher in Europe.  'Kundalini Dance' is a powerful, shamanic, healing, journey through the chakras, our seven basic energy centres.Mark is a leading expert on using the power of the 'Kundalini' life force, and the 'Chakra' system, for healing and transformation.\n\nMark is a Meditation Master (and of Mindfulness), and has acquired the rare ability to completely stop the mind at will, which leads to clarity, focus, and a feeling of deep inner peace.\n\nMark is dedicated to helping others get back in touch with nature, and realising the deep wisdom, and healing it can offer us. Our ancestors knew this, and indeed tribal cultures around the world are still connected to this wisdom to this day.\n\nHe is famous for conducting 'Kundalini Fire Dance' journeys  outside in woodland or sacred, stone circle sites, using shamanic drumming, ritual, dance and fire. It's a way to honour the seasons, and accelerate personal liberation, at the eight points of the wheel of the year, in harmony with nature. This has now branched out into 'Xistdance', a shamanic fire dance for men to activate their divine masculine archetypes known as the Warrior, Lover, Wizard (Magician) and King.\n\nIn 2010 Mark has also pioneered the 'Conscious Clubbing' movement in the UK, which are alcohol, and drug free, dance events, with positive energy and superfoods. \n\nSince 2014, this has now evolved into an even more extraordinary movement, that is taking the UK by storm...'Kundalini Clubbing' a powerful combination of Cacao Ceremony, Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini Dance, Conscious Clubbing and Gong Bath (Sound Journey)!\n\nIf you are interested in re-awakening your passion, and drive for life, then Mark's inspiration is infectious!","about":"I am here to elevate your Spirit through Yoga, Dance, Meditation

desires, like money, sex, success and power, is what we all really want, and it is most certainly, what we all need.  Until now, the keys to Enlightenment have been reserved for the few (the spiritual elite), at the expense of keeping the masses in the dark. This can no longer continue, for an unconscious humanity, who is a slave to a system, which has greed at its core, is a danger to itself, and is a threat to all of life on this planet.  \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eNow must be the time of the common awakening..NOW\u0026nbsp;is the time of YOUR\u0026nbsp;Awakening!

Can you feel it?...  You will end all fears, doubts, worries and other illusions, that plague the mind like a dark cloud. You will dissolve your attachment to past losses, regrets and grievances. They will be lifted forever, with this shift in consciousness, in favour of the light of pure, loving awareness.   To know yourself as the pure light that is beyond death, and unaffected by the ravages of time, is to relax into the deepest rest ever known.  When the light comes on, life becomes simple, decisions become easy, and things begin to flow with ease and grace.  You will be elevated above all problems that previously seemed so big, as they will no longer have any weight. They will have no power over you, for you will shine the light of clarity on all things, like a lighthouse into the darkness.  The joy that comes from such a shift, from mental obsession, to the pure LOVE of simply 'being', is beyond words...and yet, you will understand it completely, for you will remember this place, as that which you have somehow always known.  \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e I had a spontaneous spiritual awakening in 2003 that changed my life forever. I have dedicated my life to dropping deeper into this connection with my spirit. This is my life purpose and my passion, for there really is nothing that is more important, especially right now.   I was immediately guided to train as a Kundalini Yogi, sit with many self-realised masters, and integrate many profound spiritual traditions.   I am just so happy to be able to share with you, the pure joy that has come from 16 years experience of diving deep into my spiritual nature, and into the incredible world of spirituality.  You are invited to embark on a journey with me that has the potential to spark within you the most profound shift in consciousness, which will give you the tools to be who you were born to be, end your suffering, and live the life you were born to live.
