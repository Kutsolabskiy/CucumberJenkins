This is the platform where you can hack legally and at the same time you can make money. You can hack many different companies like Twitter, Yahoo, Uber, Coinbase, and a lot more. And you can get paid for your findings, for example $100, $1,000, or even $10,000 per one bug. It’s just amazing. All you need is Internet connection and knowledge. Yes - you need knowledge to go from zero to thousands of dollars at HackerOne, and in this online training I’m going to share my knowledge with you.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI’m one of the top hackers at HackerOne and I know quite a lot about hacking and making money that way. In this self-paced online training I’ll present many award-winning bugs. The more you play with award-winning-bugs the more knowledge you get and the more knowledge you have, the more money you can make. I’ll also discuss a successful bug hunting strategy that I have been using in the recent years. What’s more, I’ll present a lot of demos, because I want you to see how all these things work in practice.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThis self-paced online training is composed of 6 different courses:\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e- Start Hacking and Making Money Today at HackerOne\u003cbr\u003e\n- Keep Hacking and Making Money at HackerOne\u003cbr\u003e\n- Case Studies of Award-Winning XSS Attacks: Part 1\u003cbr\u003e\n- Case Studies of Award-Winning XSS Attacks: Part 2\u003cbr\u003e\n- DOUBLE Your Web Hacking Rewards with Fuzzing\u003cbr\u003e\n- How Web Hackers Make BIG MONEY: Remote Code Execution\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the 1st course I will discuss the 5 bugs that I recommend you to start with and I’ll introduce you to the strategy that I have been using successfully for a long time. In the 2nd course, you’ll master the strategy and you’ll play with the next 5 bugs. In the 3rd course I’ll demonstrate award-winning XSS attacks (cross-site scripting). It turns out, that you can get a 4-digit ($$$$) reward per single XSS, but to make it happen you need to learn about non-standard XSS attacks and this is exactly what I’ll present to you. Next, in course No. 4 I’ll demonstrate more award-winning XSS attacks, because I want you to become a professional XSS hunter earning more and and more money. In course No. 5, I will present fuzzing, which is one of the most powerful vulnerability detection techniques, and I’ll show you how you can use this technique to double your web hacking rewards. And finally, I’ll tell you how to make big money with RCE, which stands for remote code execution. This is the most dangerous attack and companies are willing to give you a 5-digit reward ($$$$$) per single RCE, which is just awesome.

Because in order to really cultivate the life we really want, we have to start clean and do whatever we can to make sure it will all come true (Hey, you can’t be a famous singer if you think you have stage fright!).\u003cbr\u003e\nHow To Overcome Your Self-Limiting Beliefs\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nThere are steps that you can take to overcome your limiting beliefs and start clean with full empowerment. These steps will help you eliminate all of your previous limiting beliefs and help you tackle life with new confidence and understanding.\u003cbr\u003e\n1. Acknowledge Your Self-Limiting Beliefs\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nThe first step is to be totally honest with yourself. What limiting beliefs do you think you have? Take a piece of paper and write down the self-limiting beliefs that you know are hindering your personal growth. These beliefs could include anything from fear, excuses, experience, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nFor example:\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t talk in front of large audiences.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t smile/interact with strangers.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t open my heart and really love someone.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nEtc.\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Find The Core Reasons For Those Beliefs\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nAfter you list all of those self-limiting beliefs that you have, try to understand the reasons for why you have those beliefs. These reasons could be various, but usually, it’s because of your childhood experience/societal programming.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nFor example:\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t open my heart and really love someone because I’ve been deeply hurt in the past.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t talk in front of large audiences because those audiences are judging me and my every move.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t smile/interact with strangers because it’s creepy. My parents told me so.\u003cbr\u003e\n3. Understand That Those Beliefs Are Simply Not True\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nIf we take a look at the examples above, we will find out that most of those beliefs are unjustified. Usually, these beliefs appear because you have one (or more) bad experience regarding these beliefs, and automatically your brain shuts down to the possibility of you doing it. But this can be changed simply by shifting our mindset to the more empowering one. Understand that many of these beliefs are not true, and the foundation of these beliefs are very subjective.\u003cbr\u003e\n4. Arm Yourself With New, Empowering Beliefs\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nThe next step to take after acknowledging that those beliefs you held are simply not true, is to form new beliefs. Use this time of epiphany to form new beliefs that serve you. Choose your new beliefs carefully, because these new beliefs will manifest into your life.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nAfter changing all of those limiting beliefs with new, empowering, and positive ones, start acting as if. Start acting like you are the new person that has all of these positive beliefs inside of them. It might be hard to change (It might take weeks or months), but with proper dedication, you will get there.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nLet’s take an example:\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nFor your previous self-limiting beliefs “I can’t speak in front of large audiences”, change them to “I am comfortable speaking in front of large audiences \u0026amp; I have an excellent public speaking ability”. After doing this, proactively act as if you are comfortable speaking in front of large audiences. You could do this after you learn many tips on being an excellent public speaker, join a public speaking community, and seek challenges to prove your new-found beliefs.\u003cbr\u003e\n5. Gather Evidence While Challenging Your New Found Beliefs\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nAfter doing all of above steps, the next thing you can do is seek evidence of your new-found beliefs. You will find that the more you spend time believing and acting like ‘the new you’, the more it becomes true in your reality.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nYou can finally say; Goodbye self-limiting beliefs!

These beliefs could include anything from fear, excuses, experience, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nFor example:\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t talk in front of large audiences.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t smile/interact with strangers.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t open my heart and really love someone.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nEtc.\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Find The Core Reasons For Those Beliefs\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nAfter you list all of those self-limiting beliefs that you have, try to understand the reasons for why you have those beliefs. These reasons could be various, but usually, it’s because of your childhood experience/societal programming.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nFor example:\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t open my heart and really love someone because I’ve been deeply hurt in the past.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t talk in front of large audiences because those audiences are judging me and my every move.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t smile/interact with strangers because it’s creepy. My parents told me so.\u003cbr\u003e\n3. Understand That Those Beliefs Are Simply Not True\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nIf we take a look at the examples above, we will find out that most of those beliefs are unjustified. Usually, these beliefs appear because you have one (or more) bad experience regarding these beliefs, and automatically your brain shuts down to the possibility of you doing it. But this can be changed simply by shifting our mindset to the more empowering one. Understand that many of these beliefs are not true, and the foundation of these beliefs are very subjective.\u003cbr\u003e\n4. Arm Yourself With New, Empowering Beliefs\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nThe next step to take after acknowledging that those beliefs you held are simply not true, is to form new beliefs. Use this time of epiphany to form new beliefs that serve you. Choose your new beliefs carefully, because these new beliefs will manifest into your life.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nAfter changing all of those limiting beliefs with new, empowering, and positive ones, start acting as if. Start acting like you are the new person that has all of these positive beliefs inside of them. It might be hard to change (It might take weeks or months), but with proper dedication, you will get there.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nLet’s take an example:\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nFor your previous self-limiting beliefs “I can’t speak in front of large audiences”, change them to “I am comfortable speaking in front of large audiences \u0026amp; I have an excellent public speaking ability”. After doing this, proactively act as if you are comfortable speaking in front of large audiences. You could do this after you learn many tips on being an excellent public speaker, join a public speaking community, and seek challenges to prove your new-found beliefs.\u003cbr\u003e\n5. Gather Evidence While Challenging Your New Found Beliefs\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nAfter doing all of above steps, the next thing you can do is seek evidence of your new-found beliefs. You will find that the more you spend time believing and acting like ‘the new you’, the more it becomes true in your reality.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nYou can finally say; Goodbye self-limiting beliefs! Now you are empowered and ready to take the next steps towards manifesting your deepest desire \u0026amp; living the life of your dreams!\u003c/p\u003e"},{"id":"5fddc70cba2f2a0001db03fc","createdAt":1608632147519,"modifiedAt":1608632147656,"version":1,"payload":{"id":"5fddc70cba2f2a0001db03fc","createdAt":1608369932903,"updatedAt":1608632147431,"parentId":"","specialistId":"5fc04d9d01dac100012b4438","accountId":"0800700d-9ee5-47a0-aafa-de74cbe70153","topicId":"cf6ab549-1880-45bf-9e94-1b9e9296b08f","subTopicId":"0b9e1c7f-164e-42b5-b8f2-325c40938d93","name":"Skin Retouching 101","slug":"skin-retouching-101","description":"\u003cp\u003eAdobe Photoshop Skin Retouching course has been designed to help students advance their skills in retouching skin to remove marks, blemishes and more.

Acknowledge Your Self-Limiting Beliefs\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nThe first step is to be totally honest with yourself. What limiting beliefs do you think you have? Take a piece of paper and write down the self-limiting beliefs that you know are hindering your personal growth. These beliefs could include anything from fear, excuses, experience, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nFor example:\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t talk in front of large audiences.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t smile/interact with strangers.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t open my heart and really love someone.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nEtc.\u003cbr\u003e\n2. Find The Core Reasons For Those Beliefs\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nAfter you list all of those self-limiting beliefs that you have, try to understand the reasons for why you have those beliefs. These reasons could be various, but usually, it’s because of your childhood experience/societal programming.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nFor example:\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t open my heart and really love someone because I’ve been deeply hurt in the past.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t talk in front of large audiences because those audiences are judging me and my every move.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nI can’t smile/interact with strangers because it’s creepy. My parents told me so.\u003cbr\u003e\n3. Understand That Those Beliefs Are Simply Not True\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nIf we take a look at the examples above, we will find out that most of those beliefs are unjustified. Usually, these beliefs appear because you have one (or more) bad experience regarding these beliefs, and automatically your brain shuts down to the possibility of you doing it. But this can be changed simply by shifting our mindset to the more empowering one. Understand that many of these beliefs are not true, and the foundation of these beliefs are very subjective.\u003cbr\u003e\n4. Arm Yourself With New, Empowering Beliefs\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nThe next step to take after acknowledging that those beliefs you held are simply not true, is to form new beliefs. Use this time of epiphany to form new beliefs that serve you. Choose your new beliefs carefully, because these new beliefs will manifest into your life.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nAfter changing all of those limiting beliefs with new, empowering, and positive ones, start acting as if. Start acting like you are the new person that has all of these positive beliefs inside of them. It might be hard to change (It might take weeks or months), but with proper dedication, you will get there.\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nLet’s take an example:\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nFor your previous self-limiting beliefs “I can’t speak in front of large audiences”, change them to “I am comfortable speaking in front of large audiences \u0026amp; I have an excellent public speaking ability”. After doing this, proactively act as if you are comfortable speaking in front of large audiences. You could do this after you learn many tips on being an excellent public speaker, join a public speaking community, and seek challenges to prove your new-found beliefs.\u003cbr\u003e\n5. Gather Evidence While Challenging Your New Found Beliefs\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\nAfter doing all of above steps, the next thing you can do is seek evidence of your new-found beliefs.

I am a CAMBRIDGE CERTIFIED teacher with six years of teaching experience. i teach IELTS, FCE, PET, KET, Business English, Job Interveiw Preparation and off course Conversational and General English for all levels. A part from my passion for travel and off course teaching English, i also enjoy writing and reading in my free time, particularly about topics that analyse our society and people ... yes i am completely obsessed with TED too, naturally.\n\nMany years ago i decided to live in Italy where i started teaching english in some of the schools in Rome, but i understood straight away that those schools had a terrible defect: \"they all used just one single and repetitive method\" but i believed that every student learnt in a different way.\n\nThat's why i opened my very own school in Rome, where i was finally able to freely teach my students in my own way. This experience allowed me to grow as a teacher, as an entrepreuner but above all as a motivational speaker.

Always hungry to learn and expand his musical knowledge he studied under some of the foremost teachers at the time. \n\nHe spent the 80s honing not only his performance and technical skills but also his teaching abilities.\n\nAs well as performing in various rock bands he started teaching in various schools and academies including Kent County Schools where he was employed as their first contemporary music instructor for the guitar.\n\nIn the late 80s he relocated to London, working in recording studios recording and doing session work during the daytime and playing live in the numerous bars and clubs in the evenings. He also set up his own private teaching company. As his experience working in studios grew he began to record music for advertising and marketing companies, and small radio stations. As well as his teaching role he worked as a session musician recording music for record companies including Virgin Records and Acid Jazz.\n\nIn the 90s he made the bold step of moving to Florida. Where he focused on teaching, working privately and also in schools in the Orlando region. During that time, he was lucky to meet some great musicians that encouraged him to continue his own personal studies and grow his musical knowledge.\n\nAs one who loves to travel and see new places he decided that his next stop would be Panama. A great place to learn Jazz and amazing Latin Rhythm. He really enjoyed his time down there and worked some wonderful bars and clubs. It felt like everyone wanted to learn to play the guitar, young and old.\n\nNext stop was Dubai. Here he focused 100% on teaching. It was actually in Dubai that he started offering Skype Guitar lessons to students based in the Middle East, now he spends more time in front of a computer than he does in the classroom. His love for teaching and exploring new technology means he can bring new and interesting ideas to his lessons.","firstName":"Geoff","lastName":"Sinker","photo":{"id":"ecd46d5a-c4a2-4c39-acae-64b8b5d7ed0b","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[{"id":"8f6c4986-fa70-412a-8e83-3761af6c900c","type":"3

","specialistOverview":"\u003cp\u003eMy name is Katrina. I have lived studied and worked in the UK for 20 years. I used to be a college lecturer, specialised in adult Autism. I am now back on my home territory of Malaysian Borneo, where I run and own a stress management centre, called 'Whole Life Stress Management'. The aim of my centre is to help people gain better health and control over their lives. At my studio I help individuals on a 121 basis get control over their challenges. This could be helping people manage their weight, conquer physical pain, anxiety and depression. I have an MA in adult autism, that relates to anxiety, and I have also derived a course particularly for that in mind. Through experience, I have found most people's problems relate to the stress they endure in this modern world we live in. I have therefore decided to create courses of what I do at my centre, online so that it is opened to the rest of the world to access. My courses concentrate on approaching health, wellness, weight loss and youthfulness as well as conquering one's own authenticity and gaining independence through the art of stress management. It's all about conquering challenging emotions before considering food and lifestyle choices.

For me the front squat when using weight wins out every time over the conventional back squat, for the following reasons:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere is less spinal load and flexion\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e- Basically meaning our spines are subjected to less abuse, this is a great thing as the spine needs to last us for a lifetime and the last thing it needs is regular compression from heavyweights.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFree abdominal training -\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;While the back squat does cause the abs to work, it is not to the same extent as the front squat.

Typically, when an order is initiated, the credit card information is transmitted to the payment processor. The processor then checks to see if:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe credit card number, expiration date, and security code information are correct and up-to-date.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThere is sufficient credit available in the purchaser's account.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eThe card has not been reported stolen.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThen the processor either authorizes the transaction or declines the transaction based on what it finds. For an additional fee, it can check the numbers in address and ZIP code fields to see if they conform to those on file for the customer's credit card, then report back to the merchant. This is called AVS (Address Verification Service). All this information is transmitted back to your shopping cart within a few seconds using the payment gateway. At the end of the day, the payment processor will \"settle\" the funds, that is, withdraw funds from the purchaser's credit card account and deposit funds into the bank account designated by the merchant credit card account contract.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecurity Level\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePayment gateways use very secure means of transmitting sensitive information over the Internet so long as they are installed properly.

Thus it takes special programming and testing to set up a shopping cart for a particular payment gateway. As a result, each shopping cart will offer only a limited number of payment gateway choices for which this programming is built-in. Be sure to check your shopping cart to make sure your preferred payment gateway is available.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReasons to Look Beyond Cost\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy would you spend more?

Risk management systems often work on a point system, assigning points for such warning signs as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSuspect customer IP addresses\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eHigh ticket purchases made in the middle of the night\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eLess than perfect AVS matching (address verification)\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCustomer computer IP address locations that don't correspond to the shipping address given\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eMistakes in entering credit card information\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eDifferent shipping address from a billing address\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe more points a transaction accumulates, the higher the chance it is fraudulent.

Finally, shop for a merchant credit card account that offers good terms and bundles with it a payment gateway compatible with your shopping cart.

A part from my passion for travel and off course teaching English, i also enjoy writing and reading in my free time, particularly about topics that analyse our society and people ... yes i am completely obsessed with TED too, naturally.\n\nMany years ago i decided to live in Italy where i started teaching english in some of the schools in Rome, but i understood straight away that those schools had a terrible defect: \"they all used just one single and repetitive method\" but i believed that every student learnt in a different way.\n\nThat's why i opened my very own school in Rome, where i was finally able to freely teach my students in my own way. This experience allowed me to grow as a teacher, as an entrepreuner but above all as a motivational speaker. Yes, beacuse students must be continuously motivated.\n\nLiving in Italy i learnt first hand what it's like to have to learn another language, therefore my teaching approach is completely based around helping my students overcome the English language jitters and I concentrate on improving confidence and motivation within all my lessons\n\nTeaching gives me huge satisfaction, especially when students thank me after i have helped them pass a job interview, prepare for a work presentation, get a certificate like Cambridge or IELTS, pass a university exam, a contest or to get better marks at school.\n\nOk i think you got the point, so..","firstName":"Gaia Valentina","lastName":"Massara","photo":{"id":"2e98c571-c4a6-440c-ba3c-87f4f544ee9d","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"fbPromotionAvailable":true,"fbLookAlikePromotionAvailable":true,"fbIntroVideoPromotionAvailable":true,"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":9153,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":263,"countAttachments":0},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"COMPLETED"},"subtitlesLangs":[],"language":{"id":"5f1539a58bb5a6000181a1b6","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"enrolled":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"3607b94d-4b6d-4761-9a98-391f642f47f6","accountId":"3607b94d-4b6d-4761-9a98-391f642f47f6","slug":"the-complete-english-for-job-interview-course-2019-edition","topicIds":["5408f13c-8541-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa"],"subTopicIds":["97b9c888-9292-4dcf-a302-2b82b70231d0"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":3210.5,"rating":0,"rate":19.99,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"5408f13c-8541-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa","name":"Academics \u0026 Languages"},"subTopics":[{"id":"97b9c888-9292-4dcf-a302-2b82b70231d0","name":"English"}],"metrics":{"SEARCH":7637,"VIEW":5761,"CLICK":290,"FEED":17737,"PURCHASE":4},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Gaia Valentina Massara","courseName":"The Complete English for Job Interview course | 2019 Edition","courseDescription":"Success your job interview in English, improve your confidence, English grammar and answer job interview questions."},{"id":"5d9d78bbb2d9e50001ec7db5","createdAt":1574680895715,"modifiedAt":1594641656379,"version":5278,"payload":{"id":"5d9d78bbb2d9e50001ec7db5","createdAt":1594559382372,"updatedAt":1608317107683,"parentId":"","specialistId":"5d9cbe5db2d9e50001e77884","accountId":"ba72ac84-c0d2-47da-9ba0-163140a44710","topicId":"cf6ab549-1880-45bf-9e94-1b9e9296b08f","subTopicId":"0b9e1c7f-164e-42b5-b8f2-325c40938d93","name":"Adobe Lightroom CC: Landscape Photography Masterclass 2020","slug":"adobe-lightroom-cc-landscape-photography-masterclass-2020","description":"Hi, my name is Fabian Rosshirt.

Always hungry to learn and expand his musical knowledge he studied under some of the foremost teachers at the time. \n\nHe spent the 80s honing not only his performance and technical skills but also his teaching abilities.\n\nAs well as performing in various rock bands he started teaching in various schools and academies including Kent County Schools where he was employed as their first contemporary music instructor for the guitar.\n\nIn the late 80s he relocated to London, working in recording studios recording and doing session work during the daytime and playing live in the numerous bars and clubs in the evenings. He also set up his own private teaching company. As his experience working in studios grew he began to record music for advertising and marketing companies, and small radio stations. As well as his teaching role he worked as a session musician recording music for record companies including Virgin Records and Acid Jazz.\n\nIn the 90s he made the bold step of moving to Florida. Where he focused on teaching, working privately and also in schools in the Orlando region. During that time, he was lucky to meet some great musicians that encouraged him to continue his own personal studies and grow his musical knowledge.\n\nAs one who loves to travel and see new places he decided that his next stop would be Panama. A great place to learn Jazz and amazing Latin Rhythm. He really enjoyed his time down there and worked some wonderful bars and clubs. It felt like everyone wanted to learn to play the guitar, young and old.\n\nNext stop was Dubai. Here he focused 100% on teaching. It was actually in Dubai that he started offering Skype Guitar lessons to students based in the Middle East, now he spends more time in front of a computer than he does in the classroom. His love for teaching and exploring new technology means he can bring new and interesting ideas to his lessons.","firstName":"Geoff","lastName":"Sinker","photo":{"id":"ecd46d5a-c4a2-4c39-acae-64b8b5d7ed0b","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[{"id":"8f6c4986-fa70-412a-8e83-3761af6c900c","type":"3

","specialistOverview":"\u003cp\u003eMy name is Katrina. I have lived studied and worked in the UK for 20 years. I used to be a college lecturer, specialised in adult Autism. I am now back on my home territory of Malaysian Borneo, where I run and own a stress management centre, called 'Whole Life Stress Management'. The aim of my centre is to help people gain better health and control over their lives. At my studio I help individuals on a 121 basis get control over their challenges. This could be helping people manage their weight, conquer physical pain, anxiety and depression. I have an MA in adult autism, that relates to anxiety, and I have also derived a course particularly for that in mind. Through experience, I have found most people's problems relate to the stress they endure in this modern world we live in. I have therefore decided to create courses of what I do at my centre, online so that it is opened to the rest of the world to access. My courses concentrate on approaching health, wellness, weight loss and youthfulness as well as conquering one's own authenticity and gaining independence through the art of stress management. It's all about conquering challenging emotions before considering food and lifestyle choices. It's a different approach to mental and physical health that deals with our challenges with kindness, love and patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy consultations are for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdult High Functioning Autism - Work/Life Strategies and Stress Management\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor others: Kundalini Yoga Sessions (As part of the consultation)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeditation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStress Management strategies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealthy Eating for weight loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to lose weight intuitively\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCurrently, due to the COVID19 lockdown, I am now in Rishikesh India, where I have just completed my 300 hours Kundalini Teacher Training. \u0026nbsp;I am available for consultations, but based on the Indian time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","firstName":"Katrina","lastName":"Zawawi","photo":{"id":"f94fca60-32c2-4065-b299-b3428c578a78","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":21412,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":657,"countAttachments":0},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"FAILED"},"subtitlesLangs":[],"language":{"id":"5f1539a58bb5a6000181a1b6","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"enrolled":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","accountId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","slug":"lose-weight-and-get-into-shape-intuitively","topicIds":["7e14ea33-6139-4f1f-adb0-9db52041a8c7"],"subTopicIds":["f24990ca-0504-4a9f-bc5f-ceaaee721f5e"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":1671.5,"rating":0,"rate":99.99,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"7e14ea33-6139-4f1f-adb0-9db52041a8c7","name":"Health and Fitness"},"subTopics":[{"id":"f24990ca-0504-4a9f-bc5f-ceaaee721f5e","name":"Fitness"}],"metrics":{"SEARCH":8633,"CLICK":240,"VIEW":2843,"FEED":16207,"PURCHASE":1},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Katrina Zawawi","courseName":"Lose Weight and get into shape intuitively","courseDescription":"This weight/fat loss course works because many diets and strict exercise regimes don't.\u003cdiv\u003eIt works on the principle that:\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Everyone is determined to begin with, but then the rebellious human nature kicks in during a diet/weight loss programme, even if you are succeeding on it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*I\u0026nbsp;have been on so many diet/exercise regimes and I\u0026nbsp;always manage to gain the weight/fat again.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eStrictness =\u0026nbsp; rebelliousness, after a while.\u0026nbsp; Does this sound familiar to you?\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Worrying about dieting and weight loss itself brings all kinds of stress.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eStress hormones can make you fat and retain the weight you have.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Many exercise regimes don't take into account how the body may feel fatigued. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eEven if your body doesn't feel fatigued, emotionally, you may do - and this can have an impact on weight loss progress.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Following programmes can be tedious and take so much time out of our days, that we dedicate all of our energies to it.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Being on a diet can make us really moody and not fun to be around.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*A drastic change, like a dietary programme and exercise regime can take an emotional toll on the body.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eDoes this all resonate with your experiences of trying to lose weight?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Your'e probably wondering, what makes this programme so different.\u0026nbsp; Well, it's easy really!.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eTherefore, I\u0026nbsp;have created a course where:\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e1.
