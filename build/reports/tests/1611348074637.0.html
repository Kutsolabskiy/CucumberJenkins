","specialistOverview":"\u003cp\u003eMy name is Katrina. I have lived studied and worked in the UK for 20 years. I used to be a college lecturer, specialised in adult Autism. I am now back on my home territory of Malaysian Borneo, where I run and own a stress management centre, called 'Whole Life Stress Management'. The aim of my centre is to help people gain better health and control over their lives. At my studio I help individuals on a 121 basis get control over their challenges. This could be helping people manage their weight, conquer physical pain, anxiety and depression. I have an MA in adult autism, that relates to anxiety, and I have also derived a course particularly for that in mind. Through experience, I have found most people's problems relate to the stress they endure in this modern world we live in. I have therefore decided to create courses of what I do at my centre, online so that it is opened to the rest of the world to access. My courses concentrate on approaching health, wellness, weight loss and youthfulness as well as conquering one's own authenticity and gaining independence through the art of stress management. It's all about conquering challenging emotions before considering food and lifestyle choices. It's a different approach to mental and physical health that deals with our challenges with kindness, love and patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy consultations are for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdult High Functioning Autism - Work/Life Strategies and Stress Management\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor others: Kundalini Yoga Sessions (As part of the consultation)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeditation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStress Management strategies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealthy Eating for weight loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to lose weight intuitively\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am now in the UK. \u0026nbsp;I help people heal through chakra clearing Kundalini yoga, particularly if you have suffered from trauma of some sort. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","firstName":"Katrina","lastName":"Zawawi","photo":{"id":"f94fca60-32c2-4065-b299-b3428c578a78","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[{"id":"9c20a951-2ded-45a5-85d5-11328ccfd7be","type":"3 months","typeName":"THREE_MONTH","amountValue":101.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":3,"order":20},{"id":"b3a8c246-7f74-4473-9e2c-e3b0b91c505e","type":"12 months","typeName":"TWELVE_MONTH","amountValue":551.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":12,"order":40},{"id":"06604f95-32e6-42b7-bd6d-b66171949024","type":"1 month","typeName":"ONE_MONTH","amountValue":51.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":1,"order":10,"preferred":true}]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"fbPromotionAvailable":true,"fbLookAlikePromotionAvailable":true,"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":23595,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":1319,"countAttachments":5},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"COMPLETED"},"subtitlesLangs":[],"language":{"id":"60094d24883fb20001190fe0","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"enrolled":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","accountId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","slug":"asperger's-guide-to-emotional-freedom-health-and-wellbeing","topicIds":["674f9886-b68e-46e7-b94b-a78fcd42f5d1"],"subTopicIds":["8f071797-f1f0-4666-b924-d7224791b0b5"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":143,"rating":0,"rate":74.99,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"fbPromotionAvailable":true,"fbLookAlikePromotionAvailable":true,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"674f9886-b68e-46e7-b94b-a78fcd42f5d1","name":"Personal Development"},"subTopics":[{"id":"8f071797-f1f0-4666-b924-d7224791b0b5","name":"Mental Health"}],"metrics":{"FEED":21,"SEARCH":1410,"VIEW":196,"CLICK":45},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Katrina Zawawi","courseName":"Asperger's guide to Emotional Freedom, Health and Wellbeing","courseDescription":"This course is for you:\u003cdiv\u003eIf you are a person with Asperger's Syndrome or High Functioning Autism.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf you wish to find a natural way of life that is healthy and balanced.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf you wish to live your life without the rigidity of obsessive planning.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf you wish you could act intuitively (Trust your own instinct/Gut feeling).\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf you wish you could be more at ease with yourself and others.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf you would wish you were overall more confident in the body you have.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf you wished you were fitter and able to be more active.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf you feel you are in a place in life where you are not sure what to do.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf you are sick and tired of being told what to do, think and be.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf you want to be in charge of your life and make your own decisions guilt free.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf you want to step into being 'Authentically and Honestly, Me'\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThen look no further, this course will help you achieve all the above, and possibly more.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou are the participator, learner and the person who decides how far your progress goes.\u0026nbsp;

No matter what the projects were, I kept abandoning them. When I was little, I tried doing sports. I started tennis, judo, karate and basketball… everything .. for 2 weeks.

I realised this had to change.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI started reading some time management books, applying some of the things I learned in my life..\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWell .. it wasn’t that bad .. but I had to read a lot and very few techniques applied for my particular situation.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSo .. read more I told myself.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI immersed myself into everything productivity related.

I’ve held trainings in Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and a few other Eastern European countries and my online courses have over 7000 happy students.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eDuring all these years I came to identify 4 productivity bottlenecks that prevent people from developing focused productivity and achieving their goals. I noticed that once people can put their finger on the issue, the solution comes naturally to them and they keep applying it until the bottleneck disappears.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eLet me prove my point here.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhen you have trouble staying focused and keeping your projects on track,\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAnd when procrastination is your worst enemy and your internal alarm clock buzzes 5 minutes before the deadline..\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou suffer from unbalanced Kime. (\u003cb\u003eKime\u003c/b\u003e is a Japanese word which in karate means focus).\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWe usually have some techniques to help alleviate the problem. One of the most successful ones is having a 25-minute interval of focused, productive work, followed by a 5 minute break. This starts the process of educating your brain to accept a specific interval of time as *work* time.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut there’s almost always a larger issue behind your unbalanced Kime and if you’re not going to correct it, it will get from worse to worst.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou need to solve this before your whole life goes out of balance. I know so many people that had unbalanced Kime and in my early days as a trainer I must confess, I had quite a bit of trouble helping them. I spent days and nights to try and figure out a solution. And found it I did!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eNext comes \u003cb\u003eThe Zen Curse.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe Zen Curse is exactly that. A curse that prevents you from reaching your zen state.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou crave patience and having time to sit and breathe but somehow things happen and you never find time for it. You are anxious and in a hurry and life tries to overthrow your plans and send you in disarray. Unexpected situations appear and it’s so hard to slow down and take a breath ..\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBeing in a hurry all of the time is one of the worst conditions us as humans find ourselves in. It impacts both our bodies and our minds. Stress is evil! And learning how to be patient and get rid of all the “bad” feelings that come from the inevitability of fate is hard .. dem’ hard.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhen you look at that empty calendar you’re not actually looking at free time. In fact, you are looking at occupied time that you have yet to identify. An empty calendar is actually a full day.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe Zen Curse is a state most of us go through from time to time.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAnd we usually have some techniques to help mitigate the problem. One of the most common ones is meditation. And you may think meditation, pfah!, tried it and it doesn’t work for me. I tried it too, for 3 years, before I got the specific meditation type that I could work with. The trick was to start so easy that my brain wouldn’t be able to find an excuse to stop it. I tried it for 5 minutes a day. 5 minutes, anybody can do that! And now I’m doing it for half an hour, daily!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut meditation only mitigates your problem and you need to fight the issue behind the issue, so to speak.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThen comes \u003cb\u003eThe Habit Cracker\u003c/b\u003e. This is the state where you strive to develop long lasting habits but things happen, disruptions appear and you forfeit those habits. Maybe you don’t even remember when you abandoned them.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSome habits.. you stick with .. for some time, then you skip those one or two days at the gym, then, a week .. and one year later, you find that gym membership card discarded in that dark corner of our closet.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBeing unable to stick to your habits may even give you the feeling that you shouldn’t even start them. And so the days go by and you forfeit the chance for exercising, meditating or working on your project.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAn effective technique to mitigate \u003cb\u003eThe Habit Cracker is habit linking\u003c/b\u003e. That is creating a habit that follows an already established habit. For example, if you want to drink a glass of water each morning, take your toothbrush and put it in a water glass, instead of its usual place. Each morning, you’ll see the water glass when you take your toothbrush and you’ll know what to do.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThis technique alleviates your situation but it hardly fixes it. Developing long lasting habits takes more time to do .. but it’s achievable. One of the 2 techniques is mentioned later in the letter.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAnd the last productivity bottleneck is \u003cb\u003eFunambulism\u003c/b\u003e.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eFunam..’what? \u003cb\u003eFunambulism\u003c/b\u003e, also known as tightrope walking.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou go through your life stepping on a tightrope and if you take a step a bit to the left, there go your professional achievements .. you take a step to the right .. your spouse starts the family melodrama.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIt is the situation where you strive for work / life balance but the rope is thin and your comfort lacking. Where you find that life doesn’t let you prioritise, where situations pop up and disrupt you. Where you don’t know what will happen next.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut enough information.

I also participated in some of his courses. I am very glad that I did. At the beginning I was a bit skeptical about the perspectives he presented, because I was used to a completely different lifestyle. I was determined to believe in him blindly at the start and to continue to do so if I had results. In doing so, I applied his advice and techniques and I realized I had incredible results. I asked myself “what’s happening?” I continued to listen to him and apply what he said, even though I sometimes disagreed and thought it wasn’t suited for me. Gradually, I started to understand that there were certain perspectives that I would never have thought about. Participating in his courses helped me a great deal.

No matter what the projects were, I kept abandoning them. When I was little, I tried doing sports. I started tennis, judo, karate and basketball… everything .. for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks it was like I had an internal clock that told me STOP!, let it be.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eProcrastination was my worst enemy ..

I realised this had to change.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI started reading some time management books, applying some of the things I learned in my life..\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWell .. it wasn’t that bad .. but I had to read a lot and very few techniques applied for my particular situation.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSo .. read more I told myself.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI immersed myself into everything productivity related.

I entered another college (keeping my scholarship to my final year), took dancing classes, 2 jobs and I even had the luxury of free time.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAfter passing through hundreds of techniques, I realized what was working for me. I adapted the generic things I learned about on the internet and I personalized them into techniques that gave results.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThen I shared these with Dan, one of my friends waiting for his big heartfelt ;thank you’..\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut no, the techniques didn’t work for him!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI’ve spent days trying to help him but what I shared with him was actually what was working for me.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAnd then I got it!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI needed to fine tune each technique for the specific person who was using it.

I do this by teaching productivity principles and techniques specific to their personality using experiential methods.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI am the founder of the most prominent time management resource in Eastern Europe and author of The Ultimate Time Management Guide For Workaholics.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eFor the last 8 years I’ve been traveling around the world holding trainings where I’ve created environments for people to learn through doing. I’ve held trainings in Slovenia, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania and a few other Eastern European countries and my online courses have over 7000 happy students.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eDuring all these years I came to identify 4 productivity bottlenecks that prevent people from developing focused productivity and achieving their goals. I noticed that once people can put their finger on the issue, the solution comes naturally to them and they keep applying it until the bottleneck disappears.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eLet me prove my point here.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhen you have trouble staying focused and keeping your projects on track,\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAnd when procrastination is your worst enemy and your internal alarm clock buzzes 5 minutes before the deadline..\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou suffer from unbalanced Kime.

One of the most successful ones is having a 25-minute interval of focused, productive work, followed by a 5 minute break. This starts the process of educating your brain to accept a specific interval of time as *work* time.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut there’s almost always a larger issue behind your unbalanced Kime and if you’re not going to correct it, it will get from worse to worst.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou need to solve this before your whole life goes out of balance. I know so many people that had unbalanced Kime and in my early days as a trainer I must confess, I had quite a bit of trouble helping them. I spent days and nights to try and figure out a solution. And found it I did!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eNext comes \u003cb\u003eThe Zen Curse.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe Zen Curse is exactly that.

You are anxious and in a hurry and life tries to overthrow your plans and send you in disarray. Unexpected situations appear and it’s so hard to slow down and take a breath ..\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBeing in a hurry all of the time is one of the worst conditions us as humans find ourselves in. It impacts both our bodies and our minds. Stress is evil! And learning how to be patient and get rid of all the “bad” feelings that come from the inevitability of fate is hard .. dem’ hard.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWhen you look at that empty calendar you’re not actually looking at free time. In fact, you are looking at occupied time that you have yet to identify. An empty calendar is actually a full day.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThe Zen Curse is a state most of us go through from time to time.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAnd we usually have some techniques to help mitigate the problem. One of the most common ones is meditation. And you may think meditation, pfah!, tried it and it doesn’t work for me. I tried it too, for 3 years, before I got the specific meditation type that I could work with. The trick was to start so easy that my brain wouldn’t be able to find an excuse to stop it. I tried it for 5 minutes a day. 5 minutes, anybody can do that! And now I’m doing it for half an hour, daily!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut meditation only mitigates your problem and you need to fight the issue behind the issue, so to speak.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThen comes \u003cb\u003eThe Habit Cracker\u003c/b\u003e. This is the state where you strive to develop long lasting habits but things happen, disruptions appear and you forfeit those habits. Maybe you don’t even remember when you abandoned them.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eSome habits.. you stick with .. for some time, then you skip those one or two days at the gym, then, a week .. and one year later, you find that gym membership card discarded in that dark corner of our closet.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBeing unable to stick to your habits may even give you the feeling that you shouldn’t even start them. And so the days go by and you forfeit the chance for exercising, meditating or working on your project.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAn effective technique to mitigate \u003cb\u003eThe Habit Cracker is habit linking\u003c/b\u003e. That is creating a habit that follows an already established habit. For example, if you want to drink a glass of water each morning, take your toothbrush and put it in a water glass, instead of its usual place. Each morning, you’ll see the water glass when you take your toothbrush and you’ll know what to do.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThis technique alleviates your situation but it hardly fixes it. Developing long lasting habits takes more time to do .. but it’s achievable. One of the 2 techniques is mentioned later in the letter.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAnd the last productivity bottleneck is \u003cb\u003eFunambulism\u003c/b\u003e.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eFunam..’what? \u003cb\u003eFunambulism\u003c/b\u003e, also known as tightrope walking.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eYou go through your life stepping on a tightrope and if you take a step a bit to the left, there go your professional achievements .. you take a step to the right .. your spouse starts the family melodrama.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIt is the situation where you strive for work / life balance but the rope is thin and your comfort lacking. Where you find that life doesn’t let you prioritise, where situations pop up and disrupt you. Where you don’t know what will happen next.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut enough information.

I also participated in some of his courses. I am very glad that I did. At the beginning I was a bit skeptical about the perspectives he presented, because I was used to a completely different lifestyle. I was determined to believe in him blindly at the start and to continue to do so if I had results. In doing so, I applied his advice and techniques and I realized I had incredible results. I asked myself “what’s happening?” I continued to listen to him and apply what he said, even though I sometimes disagreed and thought it wasn’t suited for me. Gradually, I started to understand that there were certain perspectives that I would never have thought about. Participating in his courses helped me a great deal. I recommend them to you and in the end you’ll see how happy you are you’ve been part of them.”\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThis is a course that pays for itself because what you learn here will give you more time and time can be transformed into money; imagine spending your time working hard but not effectively while you could win back time by discovering effective productivity principles from this product\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eThis course has been taken by people from multiple parts of life from busy CEOs that continuously missed family dinners to Andreea, a single mom who tried to balance day to day priorities between her child and her job to get 2 hours of sleep per night.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cb\u003eI guarantee results from the very first day\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e.. due to a special bonus called \u003cb\u003eThe Beginner's Guide\u003c/b\u003e.

That's because it is probably the simplest yet efficient way to perform app building from scratch. \u003cbr\u003e\n•\tDocker CLI is intuitive and is inspired by your friendly Linux CLI. So adapting it is a piece of cake! \u003cbr\u003e\n•\tDocker images and Containers are the most portable and reliable way to ship your micro-service or web application without worrying about questions like \"will it work on his infrastructure?\" \u003cbr\u003e\n•\tOnce you are fairly familiar with containers, Docker Networks and Volumes will open a whole new world of opportunities.

What to do?\u003cbr\u003e\n•\tYou don't want to have idle containers chilling around your nodes and not serving even 10% of their capacity but you also want to make sure that your customers don't hit 404 when traffic is at its peak. On top of that, you don't have time or manpower to keep your number of web-server replicas in-check. What to do? \u003cbr\u003e\n•\tYou are a pro-on-premise kubernetes expert but your next project happens to be hosted on a public cloud platform like GCP or Azure.

A part from my passion for travel and off course teaching English, i also enjoy writing and reading in my free time, particularly about topics that analyse our society and people ... yes i am completely obsessed with TED too, naturally.\n\nMany years ago i decided to live in Italy where i started teaching english in some of the schools in Rome, but i understood straight away that those schools had a terrible defect: \"they all used just one single and repetitive method\" but i believed that every student learnt in a different way.\n\nThat's why i opened my very own school in Rome, where i was finally able to freely teach my students in my own way. This experience allowed me to grow as a teacher, as an entrepreuner but above all as a motivational speaker. Yes, beacuse students must be continuously motivated.\n\nLiving in Italy i learnt first hand what it's like to have to learn another language, therefore my teaching approach is completely based around helping my students overcome the English language jitters and I concentrate on improving confidence and motivation within all my lessons\n\nTeaching gives me huge satisfaction, especially when students thank me after i have helped them pass a job interview, prepare for a work presentation, get a certificate like Cambridge or IELTS, pass a university exam, a contest or to get better marks at school.\n\nOk i think you got the point, so..","firstName":"Gaia Valentina","lastName":"Massara","photo":{"id":"2e98c571-c4a6-440c-ba3c-87f4f544ee9d","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"fbPromotionAvailable":true,"fbLookAlikePromotionAvailable":true,"fbIntroVideoPromotionAvailable":true,"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":9153,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":263,"countAttachments":0},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"COMPLETED"},"subtitlesLangs":[],"language":{"id":"60094d24883fb20001190fe0","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"enrolled":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"3607b94d-4b6d-4761-9a98-391f642f47f6","accountId":"3607b94d-4b6d-4761-9a98-391f642f47f6","slug":"the-complete-english-for-job-interview-course-2019-edition","topicIds":["5408f13c-8541-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa"],"subTopicIds":["97b9c888-9292-4dcf-a302-2b82b70231d0"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":3215.5,"rating":0,"rate":19.99,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"5408f13c-8541-4bb7-aff9-9c284f7bd0aa","name":"Academics \u0026 Languages"},"subTopics":[{"id":"97b9c888-9292-4dcf-a302-2b82b70231d0","name":"English"}],"metrics":{"SEARCH":7637,"VIEW":5765,"CLICK":293,"FEED":17737,"PURCHASE":4},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Gaia Valentina Massara","courseName":"The Complete English for Job Interview course | 2019 Edition","courseDescription":"Success your job interview in English, improve your confidence, English grammar and answer job interview questions."},{"id":"5d9d78bbb2d9e50001ec7db5","createdAt":1574680895715,"modifiedAt":1609848916892,"version":5279,"payload":{"id":"5d9d78bbb2d9e50001ec7db5","createdAt":1609844311769,"updatedAt":1609848916844,"parentId":"","specialistId":"5d9cbe5db2d9e50001e77884","accountId":"ba72ac84-c0d2-47da-9ba0-163140a44710","topicId":"cf6ab549-1880-45bf-9e94-1b9e9296b08f","subTopicId":"0b9e1c7f-164e-42b5-b8f2-325c40938d93","name":"Adobe Lightroom CC: Landscape Photography Masterclass 2021","slug":"adobe-lightroom-cc-landscape-photography-masterclass-2020","description":"\u003cp\u003eHi, my name is Fabian Rosshirt.

Always hungry to learn and expand his musical knowledge he studied under some of the foremost teachers at the time. \n\nHe spent the 80s honing not only his performance and technical skills but also his teaching abilities.\n\nAs well as performing in various rock bands he started teaching in various schools and academies including Kent County Schools where he was employed as their first contemporary music instructor for the guitar.\n\nIn the late 80s he relocated to London, working in recording studios recording and doing session work during the daytime and playing live in the numerous bars and clubs in the evenings. He also set up his own private teaching company. As his experience working in studios grew he began to record music for advertising and marketing companies, and small radio stations. As well as his teaching role he worked as a session musician recording music for record companies including Virgin Records and Acid Jazz.\n\nIn the 90s he made the bold step of moving to Florida. Where he focused on teaching, working privately and also in schools in the Orlando region. During that time, he was lucky to meet some great musicians that encouraged him to continue his own personal studies and grow his musical knowledge.\n\nAs one who loves to travel and see new places he decided that his next stop would be Panama. A great place to learn Jazz and amazing Latin Rhythm. He really enjoyed his time down there and worked some wonderful bars and clubs. It felt like everyone wanted to learn to play the guitar, young and old.\n\nNext stop was Dubai. Here he focused 100% on teaching.

","specialistOverview":"\u003cp\u003eMy name is Katrina. I have lived studied and worked in the UK for 20 years. I used to be a college lecturer, specialised in adult Autism. I am now back on my home territory of Malaysian Borneo, where I run and own a stress management centre, called 'Whole Life Stress Management'. The aim of my centre is to help people gain better health and control over their lives. At my studio I help individuals on a 121 basis get control over their challenges. This could be helping people manage their weight, conquer physical pain, anxiety and depression. I have an MA in adult autism, that relates to anxiety, and I have also derived a course particularly for that in mind. Through experience, I have found most people's problems relate to the stress they endure in this modern world we live in. I have therefore decided to create courses of what I do at my centre, online so that it is opened to the rest of the world to access. My courses concentrate on approaching health, wellness, weight loss and youthfulness as well as conquering one's own authenticity and gaining independence through the art of stress management. It's all about conquering challenging emotions before considering food and lifestyle choices. It's a different approach to mental and physical health that deals with our challenges with kindness, love and patience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy consultations are for:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdult High Functioning Autism - Work/Life Strategies and Stress Management\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor others: Kundalini Yoga Sessions (As part of the consultation)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMeditation\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStress Management strategies\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealthy Eating for weight loss\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHow to lose weight intuitively\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am now in the UK. \u0026nbsp;I help people heal through chakra clearing Kundalini yoga, particularly if you have suffered from trauma of some sort. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e","firstName":"Katrina","lastName":"Zawawi","photo":{"id":"f94fca60-32c2-4065-b299-b3428c578a78","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[{"id":"9c20a951-2ded-45a5-85d5-11328ccfd7be","type":"3 months","typeName":"THREE_MONTH","amountValue":101.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":3,"order":20},{"id":"b3a8c246-7f74-4473-9e2c-e3b0b91c505e","type":"12 months","typeName":"TWELVE_MONTH","amountValue":551.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":12,"order":40},{"id":"06604f95-32e6-42b7-bd6d-b66171949024","type":"1 month","typeName":"ONE_MONTH","amountValue":51.99,"interval":"MONTH","intervalCount":1,"order":10,"preferred":true}]},"visible":true,"meta":{},"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":21412,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":657,"countAttachments":0},"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED","failures":[]},"fileReplication":{"status":"FAILED"},"subtitlesLangs":[],"language":{"id":"60094d24883fb20001190fe0","deleted":false,"version":1,"code":"en","name":"English"},"enrolled":false},"type":"COURSE","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","accountId":"26b57b7d-54da-4b74-8518-14fc994c01ad","slug":"lose-weight-and-get-into-shape-intuitively","topicIds":["7e14ea33-6139-4f1f-adb0-9db52041a8c7"],"subTopicIds":["f24990ca-0504-4a9f-bc5f-ceaaee721f5e"],"languages":["en"],"relevanceScore":1672.5,"rating":0,"rate":99.99,"fbReachCoverImage":false,"fbReachIntroVideo":false,"fbRetargetCoverImage":false,"fbRetargetIntroVideo":false,"fbLookalikeCoverImage":false,"fbLookalikeIntroVideo":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"topic":{"id":"7e14ea33-6139-4f1f-adb0-9db52041a8c7","name":"Health and Fitness"},"subTopics":[{"id":"f24990ca-0504-4a9f-bc5f-ceaaee721f5e","name":"Fitness"}],"metrics":{"SEARCH":8633,"CLICK":241,"VIEW":2843,"FEED":16207,"PURCHASE":1},"fbPromo":false,"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Katrina Zawawi","courseName":"Lose Weight and get into shape intuitively","courseDescription":"This weight/fat loss course works because many diets and strict exercise regimes don't.\u003cdiv\u003eIt works on the principle that:\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Everyone is determined to begin with, but then the rebellious human nature kicks in during a diet/weight loss programme, even if you are succeeding on it.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*I\u0026nbsp;have been on so many diet/exercise regimes and I\u0026nbsp;always manage to gain the weight/fat again.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eStrictness =\u0026nbsp; rebelliousness, after a while.\u0026nbsp; Does this sound familiar to you?\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Worrying about dieting and weight loss itself brings all kinds of stress.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eStress hormones can make you fat and retain the weight you have.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Many exercise regimes don't take into account how the body may feel fatigued. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eEven if your body doesn't feel fatigued, emotionally, you may do - and this can have an impact on weight loss progress.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Following programmes can be tedious and take so much time out of our days, that we dedicate all of our energies to it.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Being on a diet can make us really moody and not fun to be around.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*A drastic change, like a dietary programme and exercise regime can take an emotional toll on the body.\u2028\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eDoes this all resonate with your experiences of trying to lose weight?\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e*Your'e probably wondering, what makes this programme so different.\u0026nbsp; Well, it's easy really!.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eTherefore, I\u0026nbsp;have created a course where:\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e1.

A lot, let’s take a look. The problem we have when trying to uncover the perfect human diet is that our memories are short.\u0026nbsp;When we think back to our ancestors, we all get pictures of them tending crops, making pieces of bread, or eating rice and other grains, but we are simply not thinking back far enough.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHumans have been growing grains for somewhere around 7,000 years. This seems like a long time, but in evolutionary terms, it is a\u0026nbsp;very short time. Grain eating, especially the incredibly large amounts of carbohydrates we eat today, is a relatively new adaptation for humans. While there are many ways to argue why you shouldn’t be eating grains, there is a very easy experiment you can do in your head that will show you how silly it is that we eat grains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer to that question is:\u0026nbsp;not very long. What allows us to eat grains is that we have brains that are big enough to figure out that grains need to be processed in some form before we eat them. We cannot absorb enough of the nutrients from the grains if we were to simply go out to the field and start eating the raw grains. This isn’t true of fruits, vegetables, and proteins. That means our bodies are not designed to eat grains in the way, say, a cow or goat’s body is designed to digest these foods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGrains are the original processed foods, the processing can be as simple as grinding or boiling the grains, but processed they must be before they go in your mouth.

We are told to get 5+ servings of whole grains per day in order to achieve optimum health.

Now, this isn’t such a problem if you have been on a long run or if your a manual laborer as the energy will go into your glycogen stores (muscle) and none will be stored as fat.

Too many of us are prone to store up emotions as we have no one to talk to, or are uncomfortable speaking to others about our problems. One way around this is to keep a journal, this is something that is surprisingly helpful. Each night note down things about your day, how you feel (good or bad), and things you're grateful for. You will be shocked at how effective writing a 10-minute journal entry is at clearing your mind and putting it at ease. Journalling helps you to clear your mind and get things off your chest.\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"breaking-the-worry-habit","readTime":2,"coverFile":{"id":"557530e0-4184-4a1c-9ca8-60576af79c1b","type":"atomic:image"},"publishedAt":1611089280225,"modifiedAt":1611089280124,"owner":{"accountId":"5507ec16-6064-4fc6-a57c-227bc7bf81bc","specialistId":"6002e698e1107a0001e64163","slug":"finn-klein","specialistTitle":"Motivation Coach","specialistOverview":"","firstName":"Finn","lastName":"Klein","photo":{"id":"dade3414-5b6e-4961-852a-6c57e35487ec","type":"AVATAR"},"subscribed":false,"following":false,"subscriptionPlans":[]},"bySubscription":false,"topicIds":["674f9886-b68e-46e7-b94b-a78fcd42f5d1"],"fileProcessing":{"status":"COMPLETED"},"attachments":["557530e0-4184-4a1c-9ca8-60576af79c1b"],"calculationState":"CALCULATED","dataVolume":{"videoDuration":0,"audioDuration":0,"readingDuration":145,"countAttachments":0}},"type":"STORY","status":"VISIBLE","profileId":"5507ec16-6064-4fc6-a57c-227bc7bf81bc","accountId":"5507ec16-6064-4fc6-a57c-227bc7bf81bc","slug":"breaking-the-worry-habit","topicIds":["674f9886-b68e-46e7-b94b-a78fcd42f5d1"],"relevanceScore":1,"rating":0,"rate":0,"hasSubscription":false,"reviewsAmt":0,"metrics":{"CLICK":1},"promoCampaignWorth":0,"totalScore":0,"specialistFullName":"Finn Klein","title":"Breaking the worry habit","shortDescription":"You will learn some cool tips and tricks which can help your mind realize that worrying is irrational and a total waste of time."}],"initial":false,"total":703},"STORY_FEED":{"loading":true,"result":[],"initial":false,"total":0},"STORY":{"loading":true,"result":[],"initial":false,"total":0}}},"storiesState":{"tableStories":{"isLoading":false,"stories":[],"pageNumber":0,"total":0},"currentStory":{"data":{"id":"5fce34c5ea19040001b430ae","createdAt":1607349445212,"updatedAt":1607364148732,"accountId":"f9103704-f34b-44aa-bb41-a55d5b61c6c9","specialistId":"5f8d6c20f2e05400015abe4a","status":"APPROVED","title":"What is Builderall?","shortDescription":"It's a fully functional digital marketing platform for any local business looking for customers and marketing an online e-commerce business online.","internalDescription":"\u003cp\u003eFounded by Erick Salgado, Builderall is an open all-in-one digital marketing platform that went live in 2017.

Builderall?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFounded by Erick Salgado, Builderall is an open all-in-one digital marketing \u0026nbsp;platform that went live in 2017. Instead of buying every tool you need \u0026nbsp;to run a productive online company, Builderall offers all the resources you need in one place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether you’re just starting a business company, start-up,life or small business, or a globally expanding enterprise, \u0026nbsp;Builderall has the tools you need to succeed online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis \u0026nbsp;platform provides every resource you need to build your online business in one place, rather than purchasing every service from separate \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;providers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will help you develop and manage sales funnels and landing pages, serve as a drag-and-drop website creator, show you heat-map analytics, provide simple auto-responders, and more. This is what Builderall truly is, it has a little bit of everything. The \u0026nbsp;dashboard you see after your Builderall login is the one from where you \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;can manage all the tools. It is also known as the Builderall Office (Or \u0026nbsp;the Builderall back office panel)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg height=\"86\" src=\"https://herm6nn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Builderall-horizontal-banner.png\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Builderall Affiliate Program Review\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall works well for everyone who wants to start an online company. Whatever your design context and experience, this intuitive software, combined with comprehensive support content, helps users to develop and promote their products and services easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall offers several features that I’ll list next in this Builderall review. \u0026nbsp;Although most of these are on the Builderall Premium package, you may want to test as some can only be used with the premium package.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough \u0026nbsp;the enhancement of its UX, Builderall now also provides more than 30 \u0026nbsp;tools, making it a perfect digital marketing platform for entrepreneurs ready to launch their first online company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg height=\"90\" src=\"https://herm6nn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Legendary-Ad-2-Banner.png\" width=\"728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese \u0026nbsp;applications are then divided into five groups: builders, email marketing, design, traffic management, and social media interaction. \u0026nbsp;And for each one, you’ll also find a ‘Tutorial’ for that particular program. And this feature is handy for beginners, particularly tech-noobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you’ll see, Builderall is filled with awesome features and functions, including all the tools you want in one box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReady to dive? Let’s continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBuilder Tools\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this part of the Builderall review, I talk about the Builder section. \u0026nbsp;Under the Builder section, you can find all the tools you need to build a \u0026nbsp;sales funnel, website, landing page, online course, mobile app, etc, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ePixel Perfect Site Builder (Legacy Site Builder)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall comes with a fantastic new way to create your web and sales landing pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is their alternative page builder software that helps you to create pages for your website with absolute precision. Instead of dealing with all the complicated HTML that most places need, you can design your pages visually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt not only speeds things up, but you create the page exactly as you want it to appear. You pull them around to position them where you like. You drag to where you want the text and the size \u0026nbsp;you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeeded zero coding skills. What you need to learn is how you see it in your head, and then just drag and change sliders to get the pages as you wish. Builderall does all the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCheetah Drag N Drop Website Builder (Soon To Replace Pixel Perfect Site Builder)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is one of the flagship apps that Builderall likes to promote a lot is \u0026nbsp;the Cheetah website builder, named it because it’s supposedly fast lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt works differently from Pixel Perfect, because you \u0026nbsp;are faced with the option to create published or unpublished pages. \u0026nbsp;Either you continue your website building journey with the options to start from scratch, use a template, or choose something called a smart template. Unfortunately, no explanations clarify what either of these \u0026nbsp;choices means. If you ever get confused about how to use Builderall, \u0026nbsp;then be sure to check their knowledgebase. It will contain a complete tagginget of tutorials on mastering that tool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough messing around a \u0026nbsp;little, the smart prototype tries to pre-fill some of the details you tagging can put in ‘Tag’ categories. I assume it’ll pick up the same hue. Smart templates crashed sadly after building a tag party, failing to do something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, time to use a regular template and be honest, there are tons to choose from, covering various niches and types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m also curious that if I select anything like ‘webinar registration,’ if \u0026nbsp;it loads others like the thank you tab, then the actual webinar. It \u0026nbsp;doesn’t just load the first tab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, it’s slightly better than Pixel Perfect, the builder feels a little slicker (although it’s slower to open sidebars or even move between components, often taking \u0026nbsp;around 1-5 seconds to catch up). This app is very intuitive, so everyone can find out how to use it easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilderall Canvas Builder (Digital Funnel Builder)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout \u0026nbsp;a funnel builder, the all-in-one platform wouldn’t be complete, and to be fair, while doing my Builderall review, I’ve found that Builderall does a nice job of displaying high-level or complex funnels and enabling you to jump in and edit and component. If you’re not familiar with sales funnels (although you should), this feature will help you develop one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat it does is allow you to choose your preferred sales to funnel or map your own. Here’s what you can do inside:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSelect and use a funnel design.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCreate your own by pulling and adding different pages to one.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSelect a funnel design and change it to what you want.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis also helps users to attach, link, disconnect and rearrange pages. If you believe the designs are slightly off, you can redesign them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe canvas also lets you have a birds-eye view to help you double-check if \u0026nbsp;it’s all right. Only to let you know, it’s a brand new tool in the early stages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWordPress\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ready-to-go WordPress deployment tool is a revolutionary innovation that enables online developers to use Builderall while reaping the benefits of WordPress’ perks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach one has a different collection of features compared to the Pixel Perfect Builder and doesn’t use the same interface as the site builder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as any internet marketer knows, it’s SEO-oriented, has a wide range of sensitive models, and comes with critical plugins. It’s also designed especially for WordPress fans and others who use it as their domain hosting. While doing the review for Builderall, I found that the inclusion of WordPress is one of the best features of this platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a positive note, I find \u0026nbsp;Builderall ‘s step very tactful and smart, realizing it has its own platform and page builder. This also lets those who want to continue using WordPress save time as they don’t need to rebuild their sites through Builderall. It’s a win-win deal because both users will benefit from the two website builders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best part of it? You can also incorporate MailingBoss into your WordPress platform to give you the best experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWebinar Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall also added a piece in which users could build webinars. It’s an interactive webinar where you can do stuff like streaming live content, \u0026nbsp;sharing screen, and recording webinars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe functionality sat on the platform until updating version 3.0. Builderall enhanced it and introduced a streaming feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe streaming platform allows users to access the video directly and concurrently to Facebook and YouTube. RTMP or real-time messaging protocol makes it possible. Previously, users had to drag the videos into the webinar platform, but now they can bypass that part and play it directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCourse/ eLearning Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelling online courses or classes? Then you’ll love Builderall’s eLearning software. The eLearning platform allows users to plan courses and classes, handle students, instructors, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can make videos as part of teaching, generate quizzes, upload course content, and design tests. Furthermore, you can schedule the course and set triggers to stop students from jumping ahead of the course, allowing them access to only parts of the course they have completed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no limit to how many courses you can make. Builderall lets you build and sell as many lessons as you want. That makes Builderall a fantastic tool to create or develop an online eLearning company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eChat Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty easy really, it’s an app that allows you to run a chat feature on your chosen website. It’s that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eeCommerce Website Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou need an eCommerce shop to sell your goods or services online, and that’s what Builderall offers. Simply upload your products to the \u0026nbsp;Builderall Marketplace and select your online payment and distribution \u0026nbsp;choices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will also have access to useful and enjoyable eCommerce features including discounts, pop-ups, a smoother checkout process, and more. You may then set up an affiliate network to market your goods to your customers and influencers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, you can use Builderall to build your own affiliate website and promote and sell other people’s goods, receiving a commission from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a great idea to make cash, but not to deal with sales. Often worth noting Builderall ‘s affiliate plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon signing up for the Builderall Business Plan, you can use Builderall as a \u0026nbsp;marketing tool, receiving money from any sales you near. Builderall easily integrates with your eCommerce store a range of other platforms and resources for a simple, seamless experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePayPal, Stripe, Shopify, and more. So, whatever your job, you can use your company’s best fitting tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eApp Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of hitting your target audience via a website, why not increase your impact by connecting directly from your phones?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mobile app creator — although much too much for Builderall’s overflowing tool bag — is another innovative feature to help maximize brands. It’s a drag-and – drop builder that lets you develop apps without manual coding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the midst of the days where I would watch the knowledgebase videos to understand the tools, I was still in the beginning parts of doing the Builderall review and never expected so many tools. The App Builder helps you to create and distribute applications in Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or Amazon App Store. \u0026nbsp;This platform allows you to create, edit, and publish mobile apps. It’s free to publish software on various platforms. To make money for your \u0026nbsp;apps, you need to build your own Amazon, Google Play, and Apple user accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the App Builder, you can create a deeper, more meaningful link with your customers. Building a company app using this tool is a perfect way for consumers to learn business knowledge and access discount deals and offers, make bookings, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can drag–and–drop install a news wall to publish interesting blogs and articles, social media links like Facebook and Twitter, shop links, audio and video files, RSS feed, code search, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough this may sound overwhelming, the app designer is user-friendly. Plus, the app is free of third-party advertising, unlike many other free-market app makers, \u0026nbsp;which would also save a lot of time in creating the app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg height=\"90\" src=\"https://herm6nn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Epic-Ad-1.png\" width=\"728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilderall Directory Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the Builderall Directory Builder, you can build a thousand-page online directory in minutes. Build your local directory and become an \u0026nbsp;authority. Also, directories are excellent discussion starting tools for \u0026nbsp;more web services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilderall Booking Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall \u0026nbsp;Booking is basically a scheduling resource for those who want to arrange calls and meetings, theoretically deciding how much such calls and meetings would produce (useful if you’re a consultant or mentor). \u0026nbsp;I’ve found this to be very useful during my Builderall review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe initial setup for this tool is simple and intuitive. You can build a \u0026nbsp;new calendar, then send the various time zones, performance URLs (if you \u0026nbsp;want to do some up-selling), you can do the usual stuff like set time, \u0026nbsp;how long your sessions are for if you need intervals and a host of other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other day, I looked at one of these applications and it took about 15 minutes to find it out, Builderalls calendar takes about 5 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe advantage is that you can run multiple hosts, various types of people (say if you’re a hairstylist and you’re doing men's \u0026amp; women's hair, then you can arrange different groups), and run multiple calendars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEmail Marketing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis part of the Builderall review covers email marketing. Email marketing is critical for developing relationships with prospects, leads, current customers, and even past customers because it allows you the ability to talk directly to them in their inbox at a time convenient for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMailingBoss (Email Marketing Automation Software)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is one of Builderall ‘s tools to build and automate new or existing customer contacts. This also lets you track your leads with tags, use behavioral prompts, and easily run autoresponder campaigns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s an email system where users can send emails and reply. One of its many innovative features is the “list segmentation,” which lets users \u0026nbsp;distinguish opportunities based on their behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay, you submit an offer and your subscribers open the email and click the connection given, activate, \u0026nbsp;and alert the tool to take another action. The same goes for prospects to open the first file. The behavior can vary depending on your workflow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also contact your Builderall as much as you like. This alone is worth more than Builderall’s expense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eProfessional Emails\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuild qualified domain email accounts to handle your business communications. \u0026nbsp;It means setting up your own customized addresses (e.g.: \u0026nbsp;yourname@yourdomain.com) for the sites you added to Builderall needs a \u0026nbsp;few clicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEngagement\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEngagement involvement not only helps sell goods or services, but it also keeps your customers happy and remains with you for a long time. Increased interaction also leads to increased sales and brand recognition, \u0026nbsp;resulting in higher conversion. This section of the Builderall review covers its tools relating to engagement. Believe it or not, Builderall added a section filled with helpful features that you can use in your \u0026nbsp;social interaction and improve engagement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eProfessional Messenger Chatbot Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall comes with a feature-rich Messenger chatbot. The apps are very \u0026nbsp;Manychat-like. This method has no visual flow creator like Manychat, but you can add sequential steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin this program, you can handle several sites. You can add default responses, reply rules, welcome messages, and customize the “Start” button in the automation app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotable features are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eGrowth tools – bar, popup, landing pages\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIntegration\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFlows\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAutomation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir messaging bot also contains their webinar software. So, it’s easy to improve your webinar registrants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this isn’t Manychat’s complete replacement, it still does its job well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eProfessional Website Chatbot\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you ever needed a chatbot on your website, you should. Chat Builder helps you to build a chat app and apply it as iframe embed code to your websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt functions as the messenger bot, you set up a series of questions and potential responses, it gradually leads the confused \u0026nbsp;individual to where they have to go. It seems to work pretty well, a \u0026nbsp;little clunky and a lot of user interface wasted space, but that’s just a \u0026nbsp;minor problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSocial AutoPost App\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe advantages of this tool will be more traffic and communication without manually posting each time. This app allows you to pick your Facebook account, choose the day and time you want to share a picture or text, \u0026nbsp;and send it to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Instagram Autoresponder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstagram is a serious business for many, and any company will benefit from software that can automate certain workflows. This tool uses software to engage your followers on social media messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSMS Messaging\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eText messages can be sent almost instantly to an audience which makes this another amazing tool from Builderall. Business tools such as these along with a combination of others can truly make for a unique marketing experience. No other marketing strategy has emerged as such by sending the information straight into the hands of potential customers. With this message, companies will immediately and constantly identify their name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis method lets you hit your leads via text message. Send bulk text messages to multiple recipients simultaneously with our SMS \u0026nbsp;Messaging software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCustomer relationship management (CRM)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u0026nbsp;CRM is just a good tool, it’s useful for knowing the clients or leads, \u0026nbsp;but I should have put that actually under the ‘Mail’ line because all of these people would be added to the lists. After doing a thorough review of Builderall, especially the CRM, I’ve found that the CRM \u0026nbsp;functionality is where you can store all customer info. If it’s their contact information or sales operation, using it, you can track and record it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eShare Locker\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShare \u0026nbsp;Lockers are a perfect way to develop social interaction (or potentially annoying your customer). This powerful feature helps you to restrict links to other web pages before people share your content on social media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSocial Proof Pop-up\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave you seen pop-ups saying “John just bought this x product” in your online stores? If so, that’s what this piece does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis program helps you to add social proof to your checkout pages, sharing details about recent buyers. This will help create confidence with other potential buyers, contributing to more sales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBrowser Notifications App\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall offers unlimited browser updates to help promote activities, new blog posts, videos, webinars, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eTelegram\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelegram‘s growth to over 100 million monthly active users is driven by ease of set-up, intuitive interface, rich feature set, and security. Small \u0026nbsp;companies may use Telegram to handle their correspondence, but also exploit their audience as a new marketing frontier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis tool \u0026nbsp;helps you to take full advantage of Telegram messaging by building \u0026nbsp;automatic messages and bots for your Telegram funnels\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eScript Generator\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can make fantastic emails, videos, webinars, sales letters or sales pages with the script generator and more. This also lets you decide your avatar, find the advantages of your goods or service, and what avatar \u0026nbsp;you need to offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also like the script generator, because it will actually save time and money, as it means you don’t have to pay for copywriters or people to produce these documents, you can only click a \u0026nbsp;few buttons and get a script you can play with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDesign\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we move onto the tools of designs in our Builderall review. The design section in Builderall back office panel provides you with all the tools \u0026nbsp;you can use to build and design different materials. It has over five apps and is all useful if content marketing is one of your highest priorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilderall Unlimited Magazine Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, \u0026nbsp;using Builderall’s drag-and-drop magazine program was never easier. \u0026nbsp;They mastered the drag-and-drop, making it simple for everyone to jump in and start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the Magazine app to see what it was like, and to be honest, I liked it. Selecting templates simply gives you a lot of pages to edit and customize as you want. I love design \u0026nbsp;apps, they seem to work, but I need to go and experiment with them a lot more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMockup Studio\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMockup \u0026nbsp;Studio is a feature designed to help users design different content. \u0026nbsp;You can build materials like Facebook messages, eBook covers, product details, and catalogs using the app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e3D Photo Editor Studio\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall ‘s 3D Photo Editor Studio (short “Image Manager”) seems very easy for \u0026nbsp;users of such popular image editing programs as Adobe Photoshop or Gimp. \u0026nbsp;What could be. But when working with this tool you will quickly \u0026nbsp;appreciate its special features, particularly the performance of its functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe result of an update can be directly moved to the \u0026nbsp;Cheetah Sitebuilder’s own website. Because the edited images are stored in the Builderall cloud and are only connected to the website, \u0026nbsp;subsequent editing is possible at any time with the result that the modifications are apparent instantly on the website without further steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAnimated VSL Video Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs its name suggests, it’s all about making immersive, animated images. I \u0026nbsp;think this tool may be a bit intimidating for beginners, particularly non-tech people. But once you have it, it might be a fantastic tool. For example, you can use it to make sales videos or tutorials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, there are much better, modern animation maker tools out there. But while doing the Builderall review, I found it to be a nice complementary add-on. However, I wouldn’t pay if it was a standalone tool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eTransparent Floating Videos\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall ‘s floating video is another special feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis function allows you to upload videos with a green screen or similar color background to only view the items in front of the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch videos are useful for catching the audience’s attention on the landing pages. Only build your video, add a pixel on the landing page to show the video, and let it run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ePresentation Studio\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWant to make competent, attractive, and sleek presentations? You’ll consider the presentation builder useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe app functions like PowerPoint, but you have more options. Nonetheless, using PowerPoint will still be the preferred option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eVideo Wrapper\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the animated video app, you can make videos again. The only difference is that the video wrapper tool is usually for short images. To make its content, you must supply all the elements you need, such as images and videos. This tool has no huge number of features and such a simple user interface but serves its purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eVideo Tag Tool\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Builderall Video Tag you can add clickable elements to your videos (including website connect, email, and call button).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eVideo Funnel Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis app helps you to create and share funnel videos with actions like CALL, \u0026nbsp;EMAIL, URL, and the latest function to add FUNNEL STEPS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilderall Video Hosting\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall offers video-hosting. They’ve installed heavy-duty load handling servers. Breakaway from advertisements and automatically load content \u0026nbsp;from competitors. You no longer need to upload all your videos to \u0026nbsp;YouTube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eReports\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReports are essential for having the data you need to make marketing decisions. \u0026nbsp;I talk about the tools that relate to reporting in this part of the \u0026nbsp;Builderall review. The Reports section consists of only two elements: \u0026nbsp;SEO On-Page Report App and clicks the map. They are designed to help users use their web presence and marketing techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSEO On-Page Report App\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEO \u0026nbsp;is significant, particularly in 2020. This tool analyses every aspect of your Search Engine Optimization provides you with a ranking, and lets you know how to improve. Only enter a keyword and a website you want to rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eClick Map\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso known as the Heat Map, it’s a tool where you can click on the areas inside your website. While doing the review for Builderall, I found out that the main aim is to learn and understand what links, websites, \u0026nbsp;photos click and open. So, you know what pages to optimize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also acts as a reference on what kind of photos and information your audiences usually consume, so you know what kind of materials and subjects to share with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOther Tools\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow are some additional tools in the “Other Tools” portion of the Builderall Backoffice page. They‘re as useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eDNS Manager\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technology behind the scenes that makes the domain name work correctly makes the Domain Name System or short DNS. DNS is also called the “Web phone book” because it converts the human-friendly domain name (such as \u0026nbsp;provirtualsolutions.com) into the corresponding IP address. In short, \u0026nbsp;DNS makes the Internet accessible by humans. Using this, you can monitor your Builderall account’s domains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eVA Access\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall’s other great element. You will allow other people in your team to access your account by simply sharing your Builderall email and access key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eFunnel Club\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe funnel club is a special service available exclusively to premium \u0026nbsp;Builderall customers, where each week their marketing department plans a \u0026nbsp;new professional sales and list building funnel in various niches specifically for skilled digital marketers who continuously need new strategies to keep their businesses expanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat Is The Builderall 4.0 Update?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall previously had a bunch of different plan options for their users. Now, \u0026nbsp;they’ve simplified it down to 2. Other than the pricing (we’ll get to that later) there are a few new additions to the list of available tools. The update also brought a few changes to the Builderall affiliate program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLaunch Superstar\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall’s\u0026nbsp;own\u0026nbsp;funnel\u0026nbsp;builder.\u0026nbsp;It’s\u0026nbsp;really\u0026nbsp;exciting,\u0026nbsp;too.\u0026nbsp;All to you have to do is outline your funnel’s blueprint, and Builderall will develop it for you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilerall\u0026nbsp;Simplex\u0026nbsp;Partnership\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis gets you access to all the digital marketer training and completes your \u0026nbsp;Full Stack Marketer Certification for an additional $25 / month.\u0026nbsp;You’ll also have access to training from Ryan Deiss and the Builderall team on how to apply the techniques you’ve learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilderall Website\u0026nbsp;Agency\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePremium\u0026nbsp;users\u0026nbsp;will\u0026nbsp;have\u0026nbsp;access\u0026nbsp;to\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;website\u0026nbsp;agency\u0026nbsp;where\u0026nbsp;they\u0026nbsp;can\u0026nbsp;create custom\u0026nbsp;websites\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;charge\u0026nbsp;through\u0026nbsp;Builderall’s\u0026nbsp;checkout\u0026nbsp;system\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eOther Additions In Builderall 4.0\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther platform add-ons include the Builderall Booking app, \u0026nbsp;Builderall \u0026nbsp;Marketplace,\u0026nbsp;Builderall Design Tool, and a few more things — all in all, this launch is jam-packed with such a bunch of new features that finally bring Builderall in and among the major players in this industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow Much Is Builderall: Builderall Pricing (Updated For Builderall 4.0)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow let’s get to a really critical part — the newly updated Builderall \u0026nbsp;Pricing which came with the Builderall 4.0 update. Before the Builderall \u0026nbsp;4.0 update, Builderall offered five monthly options. Considering \u0026nbsp;Builderall is premium online software that includes many features and functions, pricing was fair. But now they have made it much simpler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehttps://funnelclub40-optin2.1bestbusinessbuildingtools.com/optin2\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"what-is-builderall","readTime":24,"coverFile":{"id":"7cc0855a-1fe7-4032-86d3-e67e2b6ad702","type":"atomic:image"},"content":{"blocks":[{"key":"bojou","type":"unstyled","text":"Founded by Erick Salgado, Builderall is an open all-in-one digital marketing platform that went live in 2017.

Builderall?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFounded by Erick Salgado, Builderall is an open all-in-one digital marketing \u0026nbsp;platform that went live in 2017. Instead of buying every tool you need \u0026nbsp;to run a productive online company, Builderall offers all the resources you need in one place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhether you’re just starting a business company, start-up,life or small business, or a globally expanding enterprise, \u0026nbsp;Builderall has the tools you need to succeed online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis \u0026nbsp;platform provides every resource you need to build your online business in one place, rather than purchasing every service from separate \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;providers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt will help you develop and manage sales funnels and landing pages, serve as a drag-and-drop website creator, show you heat-map analytics, provide simple auto-responders, and more. This is what Builderall truly is, it has a little bit of everything. The \u0026nbsp;dashboard you see after your Builderall login is the one from where you \u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;can manage all the tools. It is also known as the Builderall Office (Or \u0026nbsp;the Builderall back office panel)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg height=\"86\" src=\"https://herm6nn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Builderall-horizontal-banner.png\" width=\"700\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Builderall Affiliate Program Review\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall works well for everyone who wants to start an online company. Whatever your design context and experience, this intuitive software, combined with comprehensive support content, helps users to develop and promote their products and services easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall offers several features that I’ll list next in this Builderall review. \u0026nbsp;Although most of these are on the Builderall Premium package, you may want to test as some can only be used with the premium package.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough \u0026nbsp;the enhancement of its UX, Builderall now also provides more than 30 \u0026nbsp;tools, making it a perfect digital marketing platform for entrepreneurs ready to launch their first online company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg height=\"90\" src=\"https://herm6nn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Legendary-Ad-2-Banner.png\" width=\"728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese \u0026nbsp;applications are then divided into five groups: builders, email marketing, design, traffic management, and social media interaction. \u0026nbsp;And for each one, you’ll also find a ‘Tutorial’ for that particular program. And this feature is handy for beginners, particularly tech-noobs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you’ll see, Builderall is filled with awesome features and functions, including all the tools you want in one box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReady to dive? Let’s continue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBuilder Tools\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this part of the Builderall review, I talk about the Builder section. \u0026nbsp;Under the Builder section, you can find all the tools you need to build a \u0026nbsp;sales funnel, website, landing page, online course, mobile app, etc, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ePixel Perfect Site Builder (Legacy Site Builder)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall comes with a fantastic new way to create your web and sales landing pages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is their alternative page builder software that helps you to create pages for your website with absolute precision. Instead of dealing with all the complicated HTML that most places need, you can design your pages visually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt not only speeds things up, but you create the page exactly as you want it to appear. You pull them around to position them where you like. You drag to where you want the text and the size \u0026nbsp;you want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeeded zero coding skills. What you need to learn is how you see it in your head, and then just drag and change sliders to get the pages as you wish. Builderall does all the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCheetah Drag N Drop Website Builder (Soon To Replace Pixel Perfect Site Builder)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is one of the flagship apps that Builderall likes to promote a lot is \u0026nbsp;the Cheetah website builder, named it because it’s supposedly fast lightning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt works differently from Pixel Perfect, because you \u0026nbsp;are faced with the option to create published or unpublished pages. \u0026nbsp;Either you continue your website building journey with the options to start from scratch, use a template, or choose something called a smart template. Unfortunately, no explanations clarify what either of these \u0026nbsp;choices means. If you ever get confused about how to use Builderall, \u0026nbsp;then be sure to check their knowledgebase. It will contain a complete tagginget of tutorials on mastering that tool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThrough messing around a \u0026nbsp;little, the smart prototype tries to pre-fill some of the details you tagging can put in ‘Tag’ categories. I assume it’ll pick up the same hue. Smart templates crashed sadly after building a tag party, failing to do something.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, time to use a regular template and be honest, there are tons to choose from, covering various niches and types.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m also curious that if I select anything like ‘webinar registration,’ if \u0026nbsp;it loads others like the thank you tab, then the actual webinar. It \u0026nbsp;doesn’t just load the first tab.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOverall, it’s slightly better than Pixel Perfect, the builder feels a little slicker (although it’s slower to open sidebars or even move between components, often taking \u0026nbsp;around 1-5 seconds to catch up). This app is very intuitive, so everyone can find out how to use it easily.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilderall Canvas Builder (Digital Funnel Builder)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithout \u0026nbsp;a funnel builder, the all-in-one platform wouldn’t be complete, and to be fair, while doing my Builderall review, I’ve found that Builderall does a nice job of displaying high-level or complex funnels and enabling you to jump in and edit and component. If you’re not familiar with sales funnels (although you should), this feature will help you develop one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat it does is allow you to choose your preferred sales to funnel or map your own. Here’s what you can do inside:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSelect and use a funnel design.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eCreate your own by pulling and adding different pages to one.\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eSelect a funnel design and change it to what you want.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis also helps users to attach, link, disconnect and rearrange pages. If you believe the designs are slightly off, you can redesign them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe canvas also lets you have a birds-eye view to help you double-check if \u0026nbsp;it’s all right. Only to let you know, it’s a brand new tool in the early stages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWordPress\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe ready-to-go WordPress deployment tool is a revolutionary innovation that enables online developers to use Builderall while reaping the benefits of WordPress’ perks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach one has a different collection of features compared to the Pixel Perfect Builder and doesn’t use the same interface as the site builder.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as any internet marketer knows, it’s SEO-oriented, has a wide range of sensitive models, and comes with critical plugins. It’s also designed especially for WordPress fans and others who use it as their domain hosting. While doing the review for Builderall, I found that the inclusion of WordPress is one of the best features of this platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn a positive note, I find \u0026nbsp;Builderall ‘s step very tactful and smart, realizing it has its own platform and page builder. This also lets those who want to continue using WordPress save time as they don’t need to rebuild their sites through Builderall. It’s a win-win deal because both users will benefit from the two website builders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best part of it? You can also incorporate MailingBoss into your WordPress platform to give you the best experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWebinar Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall also added a piece in which users could build webinars. It’s an interactive webinar where you can do stuff like streaming live content, \u0026nbsp;sharing screen, and recording webinars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe functionality sat on the platform until updating version 3.0. Builderall enhanced it and introduced a streaming feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe streaming platform allows users to access the video directly and concurrently to Facebook and YouTube. RTMP or real-time messaging protocol makes it possible. Previously, users had to drag the videos into the webinar platform, but now they can bypass that part and play it directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCourse/ eLearning Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSelling online courses or classes? Then you’ll love Builderall’s eLearning software. The eLearning platform allows users to plan courses and classes, handle students, instructors, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can make videos as part of teaching, generate quizzes, upload course content, and design tests. Furthermore, you can schedule the course and set triggers to stop students from jumping ahead of the course, allowing them access to only parts of the course they have completed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s no limit to how many courses you can make. Builderall lets you build and sell as many lessons as you want. That makes Builderall a fantastic tool to create or develop an online eLearning company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eChat Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePretty easy really, it’s an app that allows you to run a chat feature on your chosen website. It’s that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eeCommerce Website Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou need an eCommerce shop to sell your goods or services online, and that’s what Builderall offers. Simply upload your products to the \u0026nbsp;Builderall Marketplace and select your online payment and distribution \u0026nbsp;choices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou will also have access to useful and enjoyable eCommerce features including discounts, pop-ups, a smoother checkout process, and more. You may then set up an affiliate network to market your goods to your customers and influencers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, you can use Builderall to build your own affiliate website and promote and sell other people’s goods, receiving a commission from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a great idea to make cash, but not to deal with sales. Often worth noting Builderall ‘s affiliate plan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon signing up for the Builderall Business Plan, you can use Builderall as a \u0026nbsp;marketing tool, receiving money from any sales you near. Builderall easily integrates with your eCommerce store a range of other platforms and resources for a simple, seamless experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePayPal, Stripe, Shopify, and more. So, whatever your job, you can use your company’s best fitting tools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eApp Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead of hitting your target audience via a website, why not increase your impact by connecting directly from your phones?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe mobile app creator — although much too much for Builderall’s overflowing tool bag — is another innovative feature to help maximize brands. It’s a drag-and – drop builder that lets you develop apps without manual coding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the midst of the days where I would watch the knowledgebase videos to understand the tools, I was still in the beginning parts of doing the Builderall review and never expected so many tools. The App Builder helps you to create and distribute applications in Google Play Store, Apple App Store, or Amazon App Store. \u0026nbsp;This platform allows you to create, edit, and publish mobile apps. It’s free to publish software on various platforms. To make money for your \u0026nbsp;apps, you need to build your own Amazon, Google Play, and Apple user accounts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the App Builder, you can create a deeper, more meaningful link with your customers. Building a company app using this tool is a perfect way for consumers to learn business knowledge and access discount deals and offers, make bookings, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can drag–and–drop install a news wall to publish interesting blogs and articles, social media links like Facebook and Twitter, shop links, audio and video files, RSS feed, code search, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough this may sound overwhelming, the app designer is user-friendly. Plus, the app is free of third-party advertising, unlike many other free-market app makers, \u0026nbsp;which would also save a lot of time in creating the app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg height=\"90\" src=\"https://herm6nn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Epic-Ad-1.png\" width=\"728\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilderall Directory Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the Builderall Directory Builder, you can build a thousand-page online directory in minutes. Build your local directory and become an \u0026nbsp;authority. Also, directories are excellent discussion starting tools for \u0026nbsp;more web services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilderall Booking Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall \u0026nbsp;Booking is basically a scheduling resource for those who want to arrange calls and meetings, theoretically deciding how much such calls and meetings would produce (useful if you’re a consultant or mentor). \u0026nbsp;I’ve found this to be very useful during my Builderall review.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe initial setup for this tool is simple and intuitive. You can build a \u0026nbsp;new calendar, then send the various time zones, performance URLs (if you \u0026nbsp;want to do some up-selling), you can do the usual stuff like set time, \u0026nbsp;how long your sessions are for if you need intervals and a host of other things.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other day, I looked at one of these applications and it took about 15 minutes to find it out, Builderalls calendar takes about 5 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe advantage is that you can run multiple hosts, various types of people (say if you’re a hairstylist and you’re doing men's \u0026amp; women's hair, then you can arrange different groups), and run multiple calendars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEmail Marketing\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis part of the Builderall review covers email marketing. Email marketing is critical for developing relationships with prospects, leads, current customers, and even past customers because it allows you the ability to talk directly to them in their inbox at a time convenient for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMailingBoss (Email Marketing Automation Software)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is one of Builderall ‘s tools to build and automate new or existing customer contacts. This also lets you track your leads with tags, use behavioral prompts, and easily run autoresponder campaigns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s an email system where users can send emails and reply. One of its many innovative features is the “list segmentation,” which lets users \u0026nbsp;distinguish opportunities based on their behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay, you submit an offer and your subscribers open the email and click the connection given, activate, \u0026nbsp;and alert the tool to take another action. The same goes for prospects to open the first file. The behavior can vary depending on your workflow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also contact your Builderall as much as you like. This alone is worth more than Builderall’s expense.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eProfessional Emails\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuild qualified domain email accounts to handle your business communications. \u0026nbsp;It means setting up your own customized addresses (e.g.: \u0026nbsp;yourname@yourdomain.com) for the sites you added to Builderall needs a \u0026nbsp;few clicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEngagement\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEngagement involvement not only helps sell goods or services, but it also keeps your customers happy and remains with you for a long time. Increased interaction also leads to increased sales and brand recognition, \u0026nbsp;resulting in higher conversion. This section of the Builderall review covers its tools relating to engagement. Believe it or not, Builderall added a section filled with helpful features that you can use in your \u0026nbsp;social interaction and improve engagement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eProfessional Messenger Chatbot Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall comes with a feature-rich Messenger chatbot. The apps are very \u0026nbsp;Manychat-like. This method has no visual flow creator like Manychat, but you can add sequential steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWithin this program, you can handle several sites. You can add default responses, reply rules, welcome messages, and customize the “Start” button in the automation app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNotable features are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eGrowth tools – bar, popup, landing pages\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eIntegration\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eFlows\u003c/li\u003e\n  \u003cli\u003eAutomation\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTheir messaging bot also contains their webinar software. So, it’s easy to improve your webinar registrants.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this isn’t Manychat’s complete replacement, it still does its job well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eProfessional Website Chatbot\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you ever needed a chatbot on your website, you should. Chat Builder helps you to build a chat app and apply it as iframe embed code to your websites.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt functions as the messenger bot, you set up a series of questions and potential responses, it gradually leads the confused \u0026nbsp;individual to where they have to go. It seems to work pretty well, a \u0026nbsp;little clunky and a lot of user interface wasted space, but that’s just a \u0026nbsp;minor problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSocial AutoPost App\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe advantages of this tool will be more traffic and communication without manually posting each time. This app allows you to pick your Facebook account, choose the day and time you want to share a picture or text, \u0026nbsp;and send it to you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Instagram Autoresponder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstagram is a serious business for many, and any company will benefit from software that can automate certain workflows. This tool uses software to engage your followers on social media messages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSMS Messaging\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eText messages can be sent almost instantly to an audience which makes this another amazing tool from Builderall. Business tools such as these along with a combination of others can truly make for a unique marketing experience. No other marketing strategy has emerged as such by sending the information straight into the hands of potential customers. With this message, companies will immediately and constantly identify their name.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis method lets you hit your leads via text message. Send bulk text messages to multiple recipients simultaneously with our SMS \u0026nbsp;Messaging software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCustomer relationship management (CRM)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u0026nbsp;CRM is just a good tool, it’s useful for knowing the clients or leads, \u0026nbsp;but I should have put that actually under the ‘Mail’ line because all of these people would be added to the lists. After doing a thorough review of Builderall, especially the CRM, I’ve found that the CRM \u0026nbsp;functionality is where you can store all customer info. If it’s their contact information or sales operation, using it, you can track and record it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eShare Locker\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eShare \u0026nbsp;Lockers are a perfect way to develop social interaction (or potentially annoying your customer). This powerful feature helps you to restrict links to other web pages before people share your content on social media.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSocial Proof Pop-up\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHave you seen pop-ups saying “John just bought this x product” in your online stores? If so, that’s what this piece does.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis program helps you to add social proof to your checkout pages, sharing details about recent buyers. This will help create confidence with other potential buyers, contributing to more sales.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBrowser Notifications App\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall offers unlimited browser updates to help promote activities, new blog posts, videos, webinars, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eTelegram\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTelegram‘s growth to over 100 million monthly active users is driven by ease of set-up, intuitive interface, rich feature set, and security. Small \u0026nbsp;companies may use Telegram to handle their correspondence, but also exploit their audience as a new marketing frontier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis tool \u0026nbsp;helps you to take full advantage of Telegram messaging by building \u0026nbsp;automatic messages and bots for your Telegram funnels\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eScript Generator\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can make fantastic emails, videos, webinars, sales letters or sales pages with the script generator and more. This also lets you decide your avatar, find the advantages of your goods or service, and what avatar \u0026nbsp;you need to offer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also like the script generator, because it will actually save time and money, as it means you don’t have to pay for copywriters or people to produce these documents, you can only click a \u0026nbsp;few buttons and get a script you can play with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDesign\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we move onto the tools of designs in our Builderall review. The design section in Builderall back office panel provides you with all the tools \u0026nbsp;you can use to build and design different materials. It has over five apps and is all useful if content marketing is one of your highest priorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilderall Unlimited Magazine Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHonestly, \u0026nbsp;using Builderall’s drag-and-drop magazine program was never easier. \u0026nbsp;They mastered the drag-and-drop, making it simple for everyone to jump in and start.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI looked at the Magazine app to see what it was like, and to be honest, I liked it. Selecting templates simply gives you a lot of pages to edit and customize as you want. I love design \u0026nbsp;apps, they seem to work, but I need to go and experiment with them a lot more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eMockup Studio\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMockup \u0026nbsp;Studio is a feature designed to help users design different content. \u0026nbsp;You can build materials like Facebook messages, eBook covers, product details, and catalogs using the app.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e3D Photo Editor Studio\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall ‘s 3D Photo Editor Studio (short “Image Manager”) seems very easy for \u0026nbsp;users of such popular image editing programs as Adobe Photoshop or Gimp. \u0026nbsp;What could be. But when working with this tool you will quickly \u0026nbsp;appreciate its special features, particularly the performance of its functions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe result of an update can be directly moved to the \u0026nbsp;Cheetah Sitebuilder’s own website. Because the edited images are stored in the Builderall cloud and are only connected to the website, \u0026nbsp;subsequent editing is possible at any time with the result that the modifications are apparent instantly on the website without further steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eAnimated VSL Video Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs its name suggests, it’s all about making immersive, animated images. I \u0026nbsp;think this tool may be a bit intimidating for beginners, particularly non-tech people. But once you have it, it might be a fantastic tool. For example, you can use it to make sales videos or tutorials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, there are much better, modern animation maker tools out there. But while doing the Builderall review, I found it to be a nice complementary add-on. However, I wouldn’t pay if it was a standalone tool.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eTransparent Floating Videos\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall ‘s floating video is another special feature.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis function allows you to upload videos with a green screen or similar color background to only view the items in front of the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuch videos are useful for catching the audience’s attention on the landing pages. Only build your video, add a pixel on the landing page to show the video, and let it run.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003ePresentation Studio\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWant to make competent, attractive, and sleek presentations? You’ll consider the presentation builder useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe app functions like PowerPoint, but you have more options. Nonetheless, using PowerPoint will still be the preferred option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eVideo Wrapper\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the animated video app, you can make videos again. The only difference is that the video wrapper tool is usually for short images. To make its content, you must supply all the elements you need, such as images and videos. This tool has no huge number of features and such a simple user interface but serves its purpose.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eVideo Tag Tool\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith Builderall Video Tag you can add clickable elements to your videos (including website connect, email, and call button).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eVideo Funnel Builder\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis app helps you to create and share funnel videos with actions like CALL, \u0026nbsp;EMAIL, URL, and the latest function to add FUNNEL STEPS.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilderall Video Hosting\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall offers video-hosting. They’ve installed heavy-duty load handling servers. Breakaway from advertisements and automatically load content \u0026nbsp;from competitors. You no longer need to upload all your videos to \u0026nbsp;YouTube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eReports\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReports are essential for having the data you need to make marketing decisions. \u0026nbsp;I talk about the tools that relate to reporting in this part of the \u0026nbsp;Builderall review. The Reports section consists of only two elements: \u0026nbsp;SEO On-Page Report App and clicks the map. They are designed to help users use their web presence and marketing techniques.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eSEO On-Page Report App\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSEO \u0026nbsp;is significant, particularly in 2020. This tool analyses every aspect of your Search Engine Optimization provides you with a ranking, and lets you know how to improve. Only enter a keyword and a website you want to rate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eClick Map\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlso known as the Heat Map, it’s a tool where you can click on the areas inside your website. While doing the review for Builderall, I found out that the main aim is to learn and understand what links, websites, \u0026nbsp;photos click and open. So, you know what pages to optimize.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt also acts as a reference on what kind of photos and information your audiences usually consume, so you know what kind of materials and subjects to share with them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOther Tools\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow are some additional tools in the “Other Tools” portion of the Builderall Backoffice page. They‘re as useful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eDNS Manager\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe technology behind the scenes that makes the domain name work correctly makes the Domain Name System or short DNS. DNS is also called the “Web phone book” because it converts the human-friendly domain name (such as \u0026nbsp;provirtualsolutions.com) into the corresponding IP address. In short, \u0026nbsp;DNS makes the Internet accessible by humans. Using this, you can monitor your Builderall account’s domains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eVA Access\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall’s other great element. You will allow other people in your team to access your account by simply sharing your Builderall email and access key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eFunnel Club\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe funnel club is a special service available exclusively to premium \u0026nbsp;Builderall customers, where each week their marketing department plans a \u0026nbsp;new professional sales and list building funnel in various niches specifically for skilled digital marketers who continuously need new strategies to keep their businesses expanding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat Is The Builderall 4.0 Update?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall previously had a bunch of different plan options for their users. Now, \u0026nbsp;they’ve simplified it down to 2. Other than the pricing (we’ll get to that later) there are a few new additions to the list of available tools. The update also brought a few changes to the Builderall affiliate program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eLaunch Superstar\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBuilderall’s\u0026nbsp;own\u0026nbsp;funnel\u0026nbsp;builder.\u0026nbsp;It’s\u0026nbsp;really\u0026nbsp;exciting,\u0026nbsp;too.\u0026nbsp;All to you have to do is outline your funnel’s blueprint, and Builderall will develop it for you!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilerall\u0026nbsp;Simplex\u0026nbsp;Partnership\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis gets you access to all the digital marketer training and completes your \u0026nbsp;Full Stack Marketer Certification for an additional $25 / month.\u0026nbsp;You’ll also have access to training from Ryan Deiss and the Builderall team on how to apply the techniques you’ve learned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilderall Website\u0026nbsp;Agency\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePremium\u0026nbsp;users\u0026nbsp;will\u0026nbsp;have\u0026nbsp;access\u0026nbsp;to\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;website\u0026nbsp;agency\u0026nbsp;where\u0026nbsp;they\u0026nbsp;can\u0026nbsp;create custom\u0026nbsp;websites\u0026nbsp;and\u0026nbsp;charge\u0026nbsp;through\u0026nbsp;Builderall’s\u0026nbsp;checkout\u0026nbsp;system\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eOther Additions In Builderall 4.0\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOther platform add-ons include the Builderall Booking app, \u0026nbsp;Builderall \u0026nbsp;Marketplace,\u0026nbsp;Builderall Design Tool, and a few more things — all in all, this launch is jam-packed with such a bunch of new features that finally bring Builderall in and among the major players in this industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow Much Is Builderall: Builderall Pricing (Updated For Builderall 4.0)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow let’s get to a really critical part — the newly updated Builderall \u0026nbsp;Pricing which came with the Builderall 4.0 update. Before the Builderall \u0026nbsp;4.0 update, Builderall offered five monthly options. Considering \u0026nbsp;Builderall is premium online software that includes many features and functions, pricing was fair. But now they have made it much simpler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ehttps://funnelclub40-optin2.1bestbusinessbuildingtools.com/optin2\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"what-is-builderall","readTime":24,"coverFile":{"id":"7cc0855a-1fe7-4032-86d3-e67e2b6ad702","type":"atomic:image"},"content":{"blocks":[{"key":"bojou","type":"unstyled","text":"Founded by Erick Salgado, Builderall is an open all-in-one digital marketing platform that went live in 2017.
